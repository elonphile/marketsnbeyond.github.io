<h3 id="US-Market"><a href="#US-Market" class="headerlink" title="US Market : "></a>US Market : <br><br></h3><p>**The U.S. stock market continued its impressive streak, marking the seventh consecutive week of gains. **The S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ reached new 52-week highs, while the Dow Jones set an all-time record. Small caps outperformed, surging by 5%. Trading volumes were notably elevated towards the end of the week, reaching a new high for the year. The VIX, often referred to as the fear gauge, dropped to its lowest level post-pandemic.<br></p>
<p>**Key economic indicators supported a positive market sentiment. The Tuesday report on consumer price inflation aligned with expectations, showing a year-over-year rate of 4%. The Federal Reserve (FED) kept interest rates unchanged as anticipated and gave no indication of pushing back against market expectations for aggressive cuts next year. Retail sales for November unexpectedly rose by 0.3%, though this could be attributed to the holiday season. However, manufacturing sector data hinted at potential disappointments.<br></p>
<p>The 10-year Treasury bond yield fell to 4%, a level not seen since July. This drop was influenced by signals from the FED, indicating a cooling inflation and more dovish stance. In this risk-on environment, corporate bonds outperformed.<br><br></p>
<h3 id="EU-Market"><a href="#EU-Market" class="headerlink" title="EU Market :"></a>EU Market :<br><br></h3><p>In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 ended 1% higher. However, major indices showed mixed performance, with France outperforming the UK and Germany. The European Central Bank (ECB) left interest rates relatively unchanged but lowered its inflation and growth forecasts for 2023, projecting 2% in 2026. The ECB also announced plans to phase out the reinvestment of maturing securities in its emergency pandemic program, signaling a reduction in bond purchases and reinvestments.<br></p>
<p>Business activity in the Eurozone continued to contract, as indicated by the PMI for manufacturing and service sectors remaining below 50 for the seventh consecutive month. In the UK, GDP remained flat for the three months ending October.<br><br></p>
<h3 id="Asian-Market"><a href="#Asian-Market" class="headerlink" title="Asian Market :"></a>Asian Market :<br><br></h3><p>Japan’s stock market saw a 2% surge in the Nikkei, supported by signals of interest rate cuts from the FED. However, the strengthening yen could pose challenges for exporters due to expectations of narrowing U.S.-Japan interest rate differentials. Bond yields fell to 0.7% due to investor sentiment on the Bank of Japan’s policy pivot. PMI data showed a mild expansion in Japan’s private sector business activity, but a political scandal involving the ruling party impacted its popularity.<br></p>
<p>The Chinese stock market experienced a decline due to deflationary pressures, with CPI continuing to decline by 0.5% compared to the previous year. Concerns about deflation triggering an economic downturn led to market worries. Other economic indicators presented mixed results, with industrial output growing, retail sales surging by 10%, and fixed asset investment rising, though it missed expectations. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) injected 1 billion into the banking system, but lending rates remained unchanged, prompting speculation that the PBOC may intensify policy support to bolster the economy.<br><br></p>
<h3 id="Other-Markets"><a href="#Other-Markets" class="headerlink" title="Other Markets :"></a>Other Markets :<br><br></h3><p>In other markets, Treasury yields rose, pushing the 10-year yield below 4%. The U.S. dollar fell against all its developed-market peers, driven partly by gains in the euro and pound following signals from the European Central Bank that they are not in a hurry to join the U.S. in interest rate cuts.<br></p>
<p>Oil held steady in a lukewarm session following concerns that supplies are outpacing demand, leading to the longest weekly losing streak in five years.<br></p>
