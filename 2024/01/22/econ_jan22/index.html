        <h2 class="title">Econ Events - Why Argentina Needs Milei</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <div class="content">
        <h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><h2 id="Milei’s-Radical-Agenda"><a href="#Milei’s-Radical-Agenda" class="headerlink" title="Milei’s Radical Agenda"></a>Milei’s Radical Agenda</h2><p><br>Picture this: a presidential candidate emerges with a platform that is as unconventional as it is bold. This candidate champions ideas such as the dollarization of the economy, drastic cuts in state spending, opposition to established norms like sex education and legal abortion, legalization of organ selling, relaxation of gun control, and even drug legalization. In many countries, such propositions might be dismissed as too radical or contentious. Yet, in Argentina, this very set of proposals has propelled someone to the presidency. </p>
<br>

<p>The question then arises: Why would the people of Argentina choose such a leader? It’s a mistake to dismiss this decision as irrational. As an advocate for the rational actor hypothesis, I propose to delve into the complex web of reasons behind Javier Milei’s ascent to power. What does his victory reveal about the current state of Argentina’s society, economy, and political landscape? Let’s explore the underlying factors that made Milei’s presidency not just possible, but perhaps even inevitable. <strong><u>One sentence to summerize: when population are sick of both parties, they tend to vote for the unorthdox president who may have potential to rescue their life with radical proposal, including Argentina, Ukraine, etc. </u></strong> </p>
<br>

<h2 id="Argentina’s-Tumultuous-Path"><a href="#Argentina’s-Tumultuous-Path" class="headerlink" title="Argentina’s Tumultuous Path"></a>Argentina’s Tumultuous Path</h2><br>

<p>Tracing Argentina’s path to its current state requires a journey back in time, well before World War II. Known as the <strong>World’s Breadbasket</strong>, Argentina boasted vast pampas, fertile lands, and a climate favorable for agriculture. During this era, its economy rivaled that of Britain and the emerging power of the United States.</p>
<br>

<p>However, despite avoiding direct involvement in World Wars I and II, Argentina couldn’t escape economic turmoil. The withdrawal of British investments, which constituted a significant portion of its economy, exacerbated <strong>Argentina’s financial woes</strong>. The country grappled with incomplete industrialization, relying heavily on imported agricultural machinery from Britain and the United States,highlighting the country’s dependency on foreign technology.</p>
<br>

<p>When the populace struggles to meet basic needs such as food, a shift in governance becomes almost a certainty, mostly during financial crisis.  The ensuing era saw the rise of military governments. This period was marked by a strategic choice between authoritarianism and supporting unions to ensure political stability. The latter option was notably visible during <strong>Peronism</strong>. The government increased public spending and overhauled infrastructure for the populace’s benefit, but these measures led to tight national finances and subsequent money printing. By around 1950, inflation in Argentina soared to 40%, outpacing wage growth, which lagged behind at 30%. This raises the question: Is the pursuit of social welfare without a robust economic foundation genuinely sustainable?</p>
<br>

<p>Successive governments post-Peronism continued to grapple with this <strong>dilemma</strong>, often opting to enhance national welfare to secure votes, despite the burgeoning fiscal deficit. This deficit was frequently addressed through increasing foreign debt. From 1990 to 2022, Argentina’s total M2 money supply skyrocketed from 800 million to 134 trillion pesos. Repaying this debt through inflation led to extreme economic turbulence, culminating in a staggering 20,000% inflation rate post the Falklands War in 1982.</p>
<br>

<p>Over these tumultuous 70 years, Argentina’s socio-economic landscape was primed for a radical change. This set the stage for the rise of Javier Milei, a candidate who capitalized on the public’s growing discontent, eventually being elected as the new president with 56% support.”</p>
<br>

<h2 id="The-Roots-of-Milei’s-Triumph"><a href="#The-Roots-of-Milei’s-Triumph" class="headerlink" title="The Roots of Milei’s Triumph"></a>The Roots of Milei’s Triumph</h2><br>

<p>Javier Milei is far from your typical politician. His eclectic background as a DJ, radio commentator, and football player, coupled with his forthright criticism of societal norms, government inaction, and Argentina’s long-standing economic woes, sets him apart. <strong>Milei’s direct and unorthodox approach has resonated deeply with many Argentinians, his policies striking a chord in a society yearning for change.</strong> His solutions to Argentina’s challenges were radical yet straightforward: Rising Inflation? Response: Abolish the peso. Government Inefficiency? Response: Disband the government. Stagnant Wages? Response: Eliminate taxes. Economic Downturn? Response: Privatize state-owned assets. Social Security and Healthcare Concerns? Response: Legalize prostitution and organ selling, while upholding gun rights and opposing abortion.</p>
<br>

<p>These policies, while controversial, seemed to offer a direct and immediate response to Argentina’s deep-rooted problems. This boldness in policy-making positioned Milei not just as a leader but as a potential savior in the eyes of many. Was Milei’s election a surprise? Not really. It appears more as a logical outcome under the circumstances. Faced with persisting errors in governance, it seems the electorate preferred to entrust the nation’s future to an unconventional figure, embracing the potential for unforeseen outcomes over the continuation of known failures.</p>
<br>

<p>Wait a second, Milei’s approach echoes that of Margaret Thatcher during the Falklands War era. Thatcher’s policies, focused on cutting social welfare, privatizing state assets, and boosting economic efficiency, were transformative for the UK, albeit with mixed outcomes. refine this expression :Mrs. Thatcher was the <strong>savior of the capitalists</strong> of that era, but she was also the <strong>living judge of the miserable people</strong>. Similarly, Milei’s strategies might spur short-term enterprise growth in Argentina, akin to Thatcher’s impact in the UK. However, there are concerns about the long-term consequences: increased wealth disparity, rising unemployment, diminished trade union rights, and potential social unrest.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>Power abhors a vacuum.</strong> As the government recedes from key sectors under Milei’s administration, unregulated capital, conglomerates, and even underground organizations might fill the void. The freedom to bear arms, as proposed by Milei, could instill a semblance of order, albeit outside the traditional governmental framework.</p>
<br>

<p>What lies ahead for Argentina and its people under Milei’s leadership remains uncertain. Yet, every nation has its trials and tribulations. For Argentina, this may be a period of profound transformation – an epoch where resilience is tested, and new foundations are laid. As Argentina navigates these uncharted waters, one can only hope for a future that fortifies the nation without compromising its core values. </p>
