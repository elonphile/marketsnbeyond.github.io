<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><br>

<p>The intricate geopolitical landscape of Eurasia has been marked by historical complexities, <u><strong>strategic alliances, and enduring conflicts</strong></u>. </p>
<p>Why do Türkiye and Hungary resist Sweden’s NATO accession? </p>
<p>Why did Russia engage in war? </p>
<p>What sparked the ignition of World War I? </p>
<p>How has the tapestry of international relations in Eurasia experienced fragmentation and discord? </p>
<p>In this exploration, we delve into the multifaceted dynamics that have shaped the geopolitical landscape of Eurasia over the years, <strong><u>from the establishment of NATO, wavering stance of nations, and conflicting interests. One sentence to summerize is Tuekey want to maxmise its interests in the need for Sweden joinning NATO for more safety.</u></strong> </p>
<h4 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a><br></h4><h2 id="Dynamic-Relationship-from-WW1"><a href="#Dynamic-Relationship-from-WW1" class="headerlink" title="Dynamic Relationship from WW1"></a>Dynamic Relationship from WW1</h2><br>

<h3 id="Reason-for-WW1"><a href="#Reason-for-WW1" class="headerlink" title="Reason for WW1"></a>Reason for WW1</h3><br>

<p>When delving into NATO-related issues, a pivotal historical juncture that demands attention is the era of World War I, a transformative period that left an indelible mark on the contours of the Eurasian continent. This global conflict, fundamentally catalyzed by the ascension of Germany’s power, ushered in a substantial reconfiguration of geopolitical dynamics across Eurasia.</p>
<br>

<p>The ignition point of World War I, rooted in the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Serbia, acted as a mere trigger in a sequence of events that had been set in motion long before. The prerequisites for this trigger were meticulously laid out, with two overarching factors steering the course: <strong><u>feasibility and conflicting interests between Germany and its neighboring nations.</u></strong></p>
<br>

<p>Firstly, the conflict of interests between Germany and its neighboring countries, particularly Britain and France, played a pivotal role. The colonialist pursuits of Britain and France had yielded substantial wealth, while Germany, along with Austria and Italy, found themselves marginalized in the imperialist division of resources. By the eve of World War I, Germany had already attained an industrial prowess surpassing even that of Britain, prompting strategic recalibration through war—an endeavor to reshape the geopolitical landscape and assert influence. </p>
<br>

<p>Secondly, the feasibility of war was facilitated by the rapid development of new weapons and equipment during that era, coinciding with the industrialization of several nations,especially german’s industrilization. This convergence created a volatile environment where military capabilities were advancing alongside geopolitical ambitions.</p>
<br>

<p>More precisely for the 2 reasons, the next is around the conflcting interests and the expansion of armaments. </p>
<br>

<p><strong><u>Germany ongoing conflicting interests with its neighboring nations. </u></strong> Germany, situated in Central Europe, has endured long period of division and historical strife, which is the best fertile land for nationalism. Before WW1, Britain’s expansive empire, where the sun never set, sought to protect its global interests. Germany, as a rising power yearning for its “land in the sun,” not only expanding in Europe but vying for overseas colonies, resources, and markets. The late colonial ambitions of Germany, lacking vast unclaimed territories, set the stage for conflict with existing colonial powers. The naval arms race between Britain and Germany further exacerbated tensions.</p>
<br>

<p>Simultaneously, economic struggles brewed between France and Germany, rooted in the geographic mismatch of iron-rich eastern France and coal-rich western Germany. Industrialists from both countries hoped to use a victorious war to unify the entire region under their own control.</p>
<br>

<p>Russia’s ambitions in the Balkans collided with Germany’s eastward expansion, while its maneuvers aimed at destabilizing the Austrian Empire exacerbated tensions. The intricate alliances and enmities weaved a complex geopolitical fabric, where the enemy of one’s enemy often became a reluctant friend. Complex alliances among Russia, Britain, France emerged, driven by shared enemies.</p>
<br>

<p><u><strong>Escalating Arms Race</strong></u>. In the years preceding the war, the acceleration of armaments reached a fever pitch. Major powers, including Germany, France, and Britain, intensified military preparations. In 1913, a major tax levied by Germany to raise special military expenditures amounted to fifty million pounds. At the same time, France extended the period of military service from two to three years, and Russia extended the period of military service by six months.  The exorbitant spending, coupled with an extension of military service and escalating naval construction plans, created an atmosphere where war seemed inevitable.</p>
<br>

<p>The years preceding 1914 were marked by a series of crises, each capable of catalyzing a major war. Disputes over Morocco, Bosnia, Tripoli, and the Balkan Wars created tensions that, once overcome, birthed new conflicts. While the Balkans cannot be solely deemed the primary cause of World War I, the diplomatic deterioration in the region became a crucial factor. </p>
<br>

<p>In essence, the start of World War I was not an isolated incident but the culmination of a complex interplay of geopolitical forces, industrial advancements, and conflicting imperial ambitions once they achived their unification. </p>
<br>

<p>While my advocacy for peace is unwavering, I recognize that the world operates under the sway of strength rather than humanitarian ideals—often validated through the harrowing language of blood and tears. Germany’s engagement in two wars finds its roots in its formidable strength, a force that allowed it to compete on the global stage. In the pursuit of territorial ambitions, war, albeit destructive, presented itself as a straightforward means, as the acquisition of land was not up for negotiation.</p>
<br>

<p>Indeed, Germany has the capability to compete with other nations, even as a late comer. Germany’s rapid ascent as a late-developing country, surpassing the United Kingdom in economic scale and technological prowess, stems from the advantages inherent in being a latecomer. Yet, the drawbacks are unmistakable, particularly the tendency to be blinded by self-achievement, fostering a misguided belief in the inherent superiority of the nation. Germany, unlike other late-developing nations in the imitation stage for technology transfer and market expansion, led the world in science and invention. Moreover, its contributions to philosophy, academics, literature, and the arts, though constituting soft power, were globally renowned. The pride Germany felt during this era, though potentially harmful, was not entirely unfounded. Since then, many late-developing countries have failed to reach such heights, or even fall behind. As for its failure in World War, Germany’s geographical position posed both advantages and disadvantages. While its central location in Europe surrounded by major nations presented wartime challenges, it positioned Germany as a formidable trading power during peacetime, with access to both land and sea routes. The sea, however, imposed severe restrictions on Germany’s navy, highlighting the delicate balance between geographical advantages and wartime limitations.</p>
<br>

<p>This international relations paradigm, deeply rooted in European history, posits that the rise and fall of nations are intimately linked to war. Any ascending power is perceived as a challenge, determined not by intentions but by strength—an inherent desire for development or dominating rights shared by all nations. </p>
<br>

<h2 id="Post-War"><a href="#Post-War" class="headerlink" title="Post War"></a>Post War</h2><br>

<p><strong><u>After WW2, Post-Cold War as U.S. and Russia diverged strategically, with Russia initially leaning towards NATO amid disintegration but later pivoting to the East due to China’s rise, reshaping global power dynamics.</u></strong></p>
<br>

<h3 id="Post-Cold-War"><a href="#Post-Cold-War" class="headerlink" title="Post-Cold War"></a>Post-Cold War</h3><br>

<p>Post cold war set the two major power seperately in East and West, so inevitably Sino-Soviet should deteriorate. </p>
<br>

<p>Between 1950 and 1963, often dubbed the “honeymoon period” of Sino-Soviet relations, both nations inked a series of agreements spanning trade, higher education, nuclear technology, and industry. The Soviet Union’s extensive support for China during this era included military involvement in the Korean War, where Chinese troops directly confronted the United Nations forces led by the United States. This shared military endeavor solidified China’s international alignment towards the Soviet Union, albeit temporarily. However, the euphoria dissipated in 1963, when official negotiations in Moscow between the Soviet and Chinese Communist Parties acknowledged irreconcilable differences. The ensuing tension escalated into border conflicts and military clashes in 1969.</p>
<br>

<p>Inevitably, after the rise of “revised Sovietism”,  The Soviet Union deployed millions of troops in strategic locations, attempting to create a Sino-Soviet buffer zone. Ambitious endeavors in regions such as Outer Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Afghanistan underscored the geopolitical complexity. Meanwhile, Vietnam, under Le Duan’s leadership, adopted a pro-Soviet, anti-Chinese stance. In response, China pursued diplomatic outreach to nations like Nepal and North Korea while fostering improved relations with Japan and the United States, particularly in the context of heightened tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The United States wanted to contain the power of the Soviet Union.</p>
<br>

<p>The U.S. extended Marshall Plans in the Western world, emphasizing long-term interests and the establishment of a new world order. Concurrently, the Soviet Union wielded force to redraw territorial lines. <strong><u>Current complex interplay between China and US echoed historical patterns</u></strong>, creating a global landscape not entirely divorced from its past, yet distinct in its own right. As the geopolitical chessboard continues to evolve, echoes of the past resonate in the present, shaping the intricate dance of nations on the world stage.</p>
<br>

<h3 id="Soviet-Union’s-Disintegration"><a href="#Soviet-Union’s-Disintegration" class="headerlink" title="Soviet Union’s Disintegration"></a>Soviet Union’s Disintegration</h3><br>

<p>Following the Soviet Union’s disintegration in 1991, Russia, under Yeltsin, faced economic challenges, political corruption, and regional issues like Chechen independence. Seeking stability, <strong><u>Yeltsin pursued a pro-Western strategy, expressing interest in joining NATO in 1991</u></strong>. However, Western “shock therapy” policies and perceived containment efforts strained relations. In 1999, NATO’s bombing campaign in Yugoslavia deepened tensions, leading to Russia’s failed attempt to join NATO.</p>
<br>

<p>Putin, succeeding Yeltsin, initially aimed to improve relations. In 2001, Russia reapplied to NATO, but under George W. Bush, the U.S. declared Russia a strategic competitor. NATO’s eastward expansion intensified, fueling Russo-NATO tensions. Despite Putin’s proposal in 2008 to join NATO, the U.S. remained skeptical, fearing impure motives. The Russo-Georgian War in 2008 further strained relations, dashing hopes of Russian NATO membership. NATO’s continual expansion, coupled with U.S. hesitations, exacerbated tensions. </p>
<br>

<h3 id="Rise-of-China"><a href="#Rise-of-China" class="headerlink" title="Rise of China"></a>Rise of China</h3><br>

<p>NATO’s continuous expansion, coupled with Western hesitation and the rise of China, exacerbated tensions, ultimately contributing to recent conflicts, including the war between Russia and Ukraine. Therefore, the war in Ukraine is not a whim, but a dynamic change in the entire East and West.</p>
<br>

<p>The onset of the Russo-Ukrainian war has spurred Finland and Sweden’s fervent desire to join NATO, indicating a shared perception of deteriorating international relations. Both nations, traditionally neutral, opt for NATO membership as a strategic move driven by the belief that a collective security framework is essential in the face of geopolitical uncertainties. This shift underscores a pragmatic calculation of common interests, as Finland and Sweden anticipate bilateral benefits within NATO rather than maintaining their traditional status as neutral countries. The quest for NATO membership reflects a strategic repositioning to navigate the changing dynamics of international relations amidst the Russo-Ukrainian conflict.</p>
<br>

<h2 id="Dependency-Theory"><a href="#Dependency-Theory" class="headerlink" title="Dependency Theory"></a>Dependency Theory</h2><br>

<p>Examining historical patterns, the recurring challenge in Eurasia lies in <strong><u>constant conflicts between core and peripheral countries.</u></strong> Peripheral nations, like Turkey and Hungary, find themselves in a delicate position, far from the centers of power. The optimal strategy for these countries involves avoiding allegiance to a single side forcefully. Instead, it is advantageous to weaken both sides unless crucial to a specific party. </p>
<br>

<p>Loyalty levels in the relationships between core and peripheral countries fluctuate. Marginalized nations, less favored, inevitably experience exploitation, conflicts, and shifts in their stance. National interests, often unspoken at the individual level, create a web of ever-changing relationships between countries.<strong><u> In this arena, there are no eternal friends, only eternal interests. </u></strong> The dynamics, be it war or trade frictions, are devoid of morality, driven solely by the responsibility to millions of people. Peace, in this context, rests on a nation’s strength, not humanitarian ideals.</p>
<br>

<p>In the quest for European hegemony, some countries find themselves stuck in the middle, distant from rising core nations, with their interests oscillating in uncertainty. Finland, wedged between Sweden and Tsarist Russia, or Poland and Ukraine, caught between Russia and Germany, exemplify this precarious positioning. Turkey, straddling Asia, Africa, and Europe, faces an even more complex geopolitical challenge. </p>
<br>

<p><strong><u>Peripheral countries must strategically position themselves.</u></strong> Some, like Poland, lean towards pro-European and American stances, while others, like Finland and Sweden, traditionally preferred military neutrality. The Russo-Ukrainian war prompted Sweden to reconsider its alliance policy. </p>
<p><br>Alternatively, countries like Turkey may choose a disruptive path to maximize their interests, echoing the historical sentiment captured in the TV series “Yes, Prime Minister” regarding British foreign policy’s goal of dividing Europe. </p>
<br>

<p>TV series lines as followed: Minister, Britain has had the same foreign policy objectives for at least the last 500 year to create a disunited Europe. In that cause, we have fought with the Dutch against the Spanish, with the Germans against the French, with the French and Italians against the Germans, and with the French against the Germans and Italians. Divide and rule , you see. We had to break the whole thing up, but that wouldn’t work, so we had to get inside. The foreign office is pro-Europe, because its really anti-Europe. The civil service was united in its desire to make sure that common market didn’t work, that’s why we were into it. If not, why are we pressing for an increase in the membership? Well, for the same reason, it is just like the United Nations in fact. The more members it has, the more arquments it can stir up, the more futile and impotent it becomes. What appalling cynicism, which is called diplomacy. </p>
<br>

<p>Characterizing pro-European actions as serving anti-European objectives may be biased. The European Union’s common market indeed brings substantial benefits to its member states during favorable conditions. It facilitates market flow and fosters market expansion, enhancing economic prosperity. However, the fairness of the global landscape is multifaceted, akin to Germany’s less-than-ideal geographical locationd during wartime, better than ideal during peacetime. To fully embrace the advantages of EU membership, member states must be prepared to make certain compromises when circumstances demand it.</p>
<br>

<p>Neutral countries, exemplified by Switzerland, employ an “armed neutrality strategy. Switzerland, nestled between France and Germany, has perfected the art of neutrality, acting as a crucial buffer during times of conflict. Its strategic positioning allowed it to facilitate military preparations for both Germany and France, offering refuge to French nobles and safeguarding their assets. Switzerland, aware of its military limitations, builds itself into a hedgehog. Its armed populace, universal military service, and strategic Alpine location create a formidable defense. This neutral stance allows Switzerland to act as a buffer, deterring potential invaders by making conquest more costly than the gains. </p>
<br>

<p><strong><u>So, the reason for why sweden wanna join NATO and the opposition to Sweden’s NATO membership with Hungary and Turkey may rely on the both side intention of seeking greater interests.</u></strong> Excuses could be motivations may stem from response of Swedish comments for Hungary’s democracy or Turkey’s accusations against Sweden sheltering Kurdish militants. More specific, Turkey is negotiating for more F weapons from US for the vote of passing Sweden to joining NATO. The peripheral countries’ goal remains securing resources amidst core countries’ competition. Diplomatic relations and alliances may shift, demonstrating the pragmatic pursuit of national interests in a world dominated by the ebb and flow of geopolitical realities. </p>
<br>

<h2 id="Takeaways"><a href="#Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Takeaways"></a>Takeaways</h2><br>

<p><strong><u>Be more cautious for the potential escalating geopolitical issues.</u></strong> Examining the map, it’s evident that the small marginal countries at the crossroads of the Eurasian continent are aligning with distinct sides, representing broader Eastern and Western forces led by the United States and China. The looming possibility of a conflict between these major powers, whether initiated by the dominant United States or challenged by the latecomer China, increases as compromise becomes elusive. Both sides may need a war to set the new order. Current events, such as the Hamas-Israel conflict, tensions in the Red Sea, and disputes in the Taiwan Strait, suggest a path toward realization. </p>
<br>

<p><strong><u>Peace and Love. </u></strong> While nobody wishes for war, history has shown that it’s an inevitable part of the human journey. In times of turmoil, peripheral countries prioritize their interests over emotions, ready to sever ties or forge close collaborations. The state machine, with its collective leadership, remains unwavering, serving the interests of millions. In this context, personal sentiments and moral unity take a back seat to the responsibility of individuals who contribute to the government, even as positions change. The country, acting as a rational entity, demands allegiance. For core countries, the pursuit of enduring love and peace remains paramount. Those in positions of influence bear the responsibility to extend kindness, having achieved their aspirations. A plea is made to contribute to global tranquility, recognizing the impact of their elevated positions on the world stage. In a world brimming with complexities, fostering peace becomes a shared imperative.</p>
