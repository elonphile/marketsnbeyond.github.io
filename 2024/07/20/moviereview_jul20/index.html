<p><strong>“Front of the Class (2008)” is a heartwarming drama based on the true story of Brad Cohen, a young man with Tourette Syndrome who overcomes significant challenges to achieve his dream of becoming a teacher.</strong> The film follows Brad’s journey from his childhood, where he faces misunderstanding and bullying due to his uncontrollable tics, to his adult years, where he is determined to prove that his condition does not define his abilities. Despite numerous rejections and setbacks, Brad’s perseverance and positive attitude help him secure a teaching position.</p>
<br>

<h2 id="Personal-Takeaway"><a href="#Personal-Takeaway" class="headerlink" title="Personal Takeaway"></a>Personal Takeaway</h2><br>

<p><strong><u>Everyone is born with unique resource endowment. We must accept that not everyone starts with the same advantages, and we must face many difficulties because of these differences. However, by finding N+1 solutions to overcome these challenges, you will become a wonderful, warm-hearted people. </u></strong></p>
<br>

<p><strong>Accept that luck may not be on your side at birth.</strong> Everyone is born with different types of resource endowment—physical, social, and economic. As a result, life is inherently unequal from the start. Some people may face physical disabilities, others may struggle with intelligence, while some might face gender biases or economic hardships. These disparities mean that fairness is not guaranteed. These disparities are not personal failures but rather a matter of differing luck or circumstance. Take Brad Cohen, for example. He was born with Tourette Syndrome, which causes him to make involuntary noises. Despite his desire to fit in and be like everyone else, his condition presents ongoing challenges. This is not his fault; it is simply a part of his resource endowment.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>Being different can lead to being treated differently by the world.</strong> Such a broader reality: others’ reactions, while sometimes hurtful, reflect the natural response to differences. Sometimes, people just misunderstand, which is natural. Whether it’s discrimination based on gender, laughter at physical disabilities, lack of confidence due to poverty, or unkindness towards LGBTQ individuals, these reactions are part of the process of navigating a world that may not always be fair. Cohen, for example, avoided attending his students’ funeral to avoid causing any discomfort. When Brad Cohen went golfing with his brother, his Tourette Syndrome caused him to make involuntary noises, leading to him being asked to leave.</p>
<br>

<p>But this does not affect Cohen from being a warm and humorous person.When others speak up for him on the golf course, he responds with a cheerful, <em><strong>“It’s okay, maybe next year.”</strong></em> When people mistakenly think his noises are from a dog, he jokingly says, <em><strong>“Yes, I have a sheepdog.”</strong></em> Such optimism is of course the best, but it’s natural to feel upset or frustrated sometimes, give yourself permission to be human. However, these feelings should be seen as part of the journey, not the end goal. When encountering judgment or misunderstanding, you might find solace in responding with sincerity and humor, such as saying, <em><strong>“I’ve seen that look a lot. It’s a look of envy, as if they’re wondering how they can make cool noises like I do.”</strong></em></p>
<br>

<p><strong>When the going gets tough, the tough get going.</strong> There are countless ways to address the challenges life throws at you. Improving yourself and acknowledging your weaknesses is crucial, but don’t forget that you possess more than just these limitations. Some people practice double ollies with a small fishing rod, others put on makeup in a taxi before interviews, and some train for basketball while barefoot. Seek out environments that align with your strengths and needs. When Brad Cohen faced rejection from a school that asked him to control his tics to fit in, he responded with grace: <em><strong>“I really want this so badly, but thank you for your time.”</strong></em> He then continued his search and applied to over 20 schools.</p>
<br>

<p>Give yourself at least 20 chances to try something new, to overcome your fears, and to persist before considering giving up. Whether you fear public speaking, struggling with exams, facing challenges in interviews, or encountering difficulties in learning an instrument or relationships, don’t be discouraged. When you feel like giving up, try one more time. Experiment with different methods, positions, environments, or even relationships. The probability of success may not always be high, but expanding your opportunities and remaining patient can lead you to the right place.</p>
<br>

<p>You have a long life ahead of you. Be patient and persistent. Eventually, you will find a position or a person who values you for who you are. You might encounter a supportive supervisor who says, <em><strong>“We are proud to teach our kids to overcome any obstacles in their lives. If we’re going to talk the talk, we need to walk the walk. Welcome!”</strong></em> Similarly, you might find someone who says, <em><strong>“I do not mind the noise you make when compared to other guys’ noise, you know, the braggers, loud-talkers, you know, like egocentric, humor-challenged idiots. Your noise doesn’t bother me at all, as long as you keep me laughing.”</strong></em> </p>
<br>

<br>

<br>

<p><em><strong>I don’t want to be different, but I am. And I have to learn to accept it. Every time someone said ‘no’ to me, it just made me more determined to prove them wrong. Every ‘no’ has pushed me to find a way to make a ‘yes’.</strong></em> </p>
<br>

<br>

<br>

<p>This is a true story. I hope that all the Cohens in all corners of the world will have a really wonderful day! At least someone in the distance wants to give you a big hug when you are wronged. May your journey be filled with resilience, joy, and the fulfillment of your dreams!</p>
