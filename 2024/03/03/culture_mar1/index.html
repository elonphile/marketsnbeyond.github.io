<h2 id="The-Allure-of-Cities"><a href="#The-Allure-of-Cities" class="headerlink" title="The Allure of Cities"></a>The Allure of Cities</h2><br>

<p>When it comes to why people love a particular city, there’s often a blend of subjective and objective factors at play. It’s a deeply personal connection, shaped by individual preferences, experiences, and desires. Each city offers a unique tapestry of attractions and characteristics, catering to a diverse range of tastes and interests. <strong><u>When what the city offer and individual preference match, affinity occurs. </u></strong></p>
<br>

<p>For some, the appeal lies in the vibrant energy of a bustling metropolis that never sleeps, making New York City their top choice. Others may be drawn to the tranquil beauty of natural scenery, leading them to favor destinations like Switzerland. Perhaps you’re enchanted by the timeless sophistication of old school charm, making London your preferred destination. Alternatively, the gritty, avant-garde atmosphere of Berlin might resonate with those who appreciate a sense of edgy authenticity. For those seeking festive excitement, the colorful carnival atmosphere of Brazil could be irresistible. If you’re captivated by wildlife and adventure, the untamed landscapes of Africa may call to you. And for those who appreciate sheer beauty and romance, Paris inevitably becomes the destination of choice.</p>
<br>

<h2 id="The-Perfect-Harmony-A-Sensory-Exploration"><a href="#The-Perfect-Harmony-A-Sensory-Exploration" class="headerlink" title="The Perfect Harmony : A Sensory Exploration"></a>The Perfect Harmony : A Sensory Exploration</h2><br>

<p><strong><u>Objectively speaking, Paris is a city that adores beauty, and it excels at providing aesthetic experiences like no other. In terms of aesthetics, Paris achieves the pinnacle, from sensual aspects. </u></strong> </p>
<br>

<p>What skin brings in paris sensually, during the spring and autumn seasons, Paris offers a climate that feels just right - the perfect balance of temperature, humidity, and sunshine characteristic of its temperate maritime climate. It’s a comfortable sensation, devoid of the scorching heat of Southern European summers, the biting cold of Northern European winters, or the relentless rain of London or humid summers in Taiwan.</p>
<br>

<p>What the eyes behold in Paris is a symphony of harmonious and cohesive Haussmannian architecture, the dappled shadows cast by plane trees lining the road to the Palace of Versailles, an abundance of artistic masterpieces waiting to be discovered in museums, and the sight of people leisurely strolling along the Seine, basking in the sunlight. Among them, you might spot impeccably dressed fashionistas clutching bouquets of flowers, adding to the city’s allure.</p>
<br>

<p>What the ears are treated to in Paris are melodies drifting along the banks of the Seine, the electronic beats of parades in November, the exhilarating performances of firefighters on Bastille Day, and the spirited chants of protestors advocating for freedom and individuality.</p>
<br>

<p>And what conversations in Paris entail are greetings of ‘Bonjour,’ ‘Bonne journée’ for a lovely day, and ‘joue contre joue’ the tender gesture of a kiss on the cheek upon meeting. In Paris, every aspect of the experience is carefully curated to evoke a sense of romance and enchantment, making it a city where love and beauty intertwine effortlessly.</p>
<br>

<h2 id="Where-Everything-Feels-Just-Right"><a href="#Where-Everything-Feels-Just-Right" class="headerlink" title="Where Everything Feels Just Right"></a>Where Everything Feels Just Right</h2><br>

<p><strong><u>In essence, much like how people have a preferred temperature range for comfort, Paris provides an environment that feels just right, very suitable, and wonderfully relaxed. Paris benefits from a combination of exceptional natural conditions and intentional asthetic efforts. </u></strong></p>
<br>

<p>The city enjoys a favorable natural conditions that strike the ideal balance. Unlike some other regions, Paris is not plagued by extremes - it’s neither oppressively cold nor swelteringly hot. Its river, the Seine, is near perfect in size and speed, unlike the Danube in Hungary, which can feel a bit too rushing, or the smaller rivers in Amsterdam, which might seem miserly by comparison. </p>
<br>

<p>This climate also lends itself to a slight intoxication from the red wine that flows freely, inducing a gentle, tipsy state rather than the inebriation of strong spirits or the sobriety of light beers. When one is slightly intoxicated, they often become endearing and romantic, expressing affectionate words to friends and lovers that they may not say when sober. It’s this romantic ambiance that makes Paris forever enchanting.</p>
<br>

<p>The presence of French plane trees, often found near the Palace of Versailles, further enhances Paris’s charm. These trees line the roadsides with just the right amount of shade and color, not overly dark green like the foliage in Taiwan during summer, nor the desolate barren trees seen in northern China during winter. Instead, they provide a perfect canopy, allowing just enough sunlight to filter through.</p>
<br>

<p>On the other side, the city owes much of its charm to the high-quality aesthetics cultivated by Parisians. This includes the meticulous urban planning, the ever-evolving fashion scene, and the countless contributions from artists. </p>
<br>

<p>As for city planning for instance, Paris’s city planning is celebrated for its wide boulevards, uniform Haussmannian architecture, iconic landmarks, and abundant green spaces, collectively contributing to its unparalleled appeal. The expansive boulevards not only facilitate traffic flow but also provide a sense of openness and grandeur, inviting leisurely strolls and vibrant street life. The uniformity of Haussmannian architecture lends a timeless elegance to the cityscape, with limestone buildings and wrought-iron balconies adorning every corner. Coupled with iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and Notre-Dame Cathedral, Paris exudes an undeniable charm that captivates the imagination. Amidst this urban splendor, Paris boasts an array of green spaces, from the sprawling Tuileries Garden to the charming squares tucked away in residential neighborhoods, offering tranquil retreats amidst the bustling cityscape.</p>
<br>

<p>Let alone refined fashion taste of Parisians, Paris, renowned as the fashion capital of the world, sets the bar high when it comes to style and elegance. Parisians effortlessly exude a sense of chic sophistication, with their impeccable fashion sense and ability to effortlessly combine timeless classics with avant-garde trends. From iconic fashion houses to trendy boutiques, Paris offers a shopping experience like no other. High-end luxury brands line the streets of the Champs Elysées, while charming cobblestone alleyways hide hidden gems waiting to be discovered. Let alone the exquisite holiday decorations adorning the shops along the Champs Elysées, the interior decor of Galeries Lafayette, and the jewelry boutiques near the Liberation Monument. They strike the perfect balance of luxury without the overpowering scent of food on the ground floor, exuding only the elegance befitting the fashion capital of the world.</p>
<br>

<p>In conclusion, the essence of Paris is encapsulated in moments of just right, like the feeling of basking in the warm sun in a tranquil park and leisurely strolling along the Seine River, taking in the picturesque street scenes on either bank. As the gentle breeze rustles through, sitting by the Seine, sipping wine, and listening to music as night descends, one witnesses couples lost in tender embraces amidst the shimmering lights scattered across the river. This isn’t merely a movable feast—it is called “<em><strong><u>Paris</u></strong></em>“.</p>
<br>

<h2 id="Paris-in-Literature-and-Film"><a href="#Paris-in-Literature-and-Film" class="headerlink" title="Paris in Literature and Film"></a>Paris in Literature and Film</h2><br>

<p>In literature and film, Paris has served as a captivating backdrop that evokes a sense of nostalgia, romance, and escapism. Ernest Hemingway’s “A Moveable Feast” provides a glimpse into the author’s experiences during his time in Interwar France, where he found camaraderie among the cultural luminaries of the Lost Generation. For Hemingway, this period represented the pinnacle of literary inspiration, where good times were shared with like-minded individuals in the most enchanting of places.</p>
<br>

<p>Woody Allen’s “Midnight in Paris” beautifully captures the allure of Paris in the 1920s, painting scenes with a delicate brushstroke of golden light and shadow, imbuing the era with an air of luxury and tranquility. Through the protagonist’s encounters with Hemingway and his longing for the past, the film explores the human desire to escape reality and seek refuge in nostalgia. However, as the protagonist discovers, the past may not always live up to one’s idealized perceptions, and the present holds its own beauty and significance, present is something you can control. <em><strong>That’s what the present is. It’s a little unsatisfying because life’s a little unsatisfying.</strong></em> At the end of the movie, the right person stood in the rain, on his favorite street, and told him, <em><strong>“It doesn’t matter, I don’t mind getting wet.”</strong></em>  ,while his fiancee didn’t understand, <em><strong>“Paris is the most beautiful when it rains”</strong></em> </p>
<br>

<p>Despite the romanticized portrayal of Paris in literature and film, the city’s allure transcends mere fantasy. As an engineering student, I refrain from delving into personal subjective experiences, but the time spent in Paris remains etched in my heart. Paris, with its complexity and richness, is a city where nothing is simple, yet every experience holds a profound significance. </p>
<br>

<p><em><strong>But Paris was a very old city and we were young and nothing was simple there, not even poverty, nor sudden money, nor the moonlight, nor right and wrong nor the breathing of someone who lay beside you in the moonlight.</strong></em></p>
