[{"title":"Book Review - A Moverable Feast","url":"/2024/03/05/bookreview_feb25/","content":"<h1 id=\"\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"\"></a></h1><style>\n</style>\n\n<h2 id=\"Book-info\"><a href=\"#Book-info\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Book info\"></a>Book info</h2><br>\n\n<p><strong>The book details Hemingway’s first marriage to Hadley Richardson and his associations with other cultural figures of the Lost Generation in Interwar France, offering readers a glimpse into his formative years as a struggling writer in 1920s Paris. Published posthumously in 1964.</strong> This memoir captures Hemingway’s experiences and interactions with other literary luminaries of the time. Through its pages, readers are transported to the bohemian streets of Paris, where Hemingway navigates the challenges of artistic pursuit while rubbing shoulders with figures such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein.</p>\n<br>\n\n<h2 id=\"Personal-Takeaway\"><a href=\"#Personal-Takeaway\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Personal Takeaway\"></a>Personal Takeaway</h2><br>\n\n<p>In ‘A Moveable Feast,’ Hemingway’s depiction of his modest yet joyous existence in Paris struck a chord with me. While I couldn’t fully engage with the café culture or grasp the nuances of the artistic milieu he encountered, his evocative portrayal of Parisian scenes, such as the blossoming horse chestnut trees in the Luxembourg Garden, transported me to familiar settings near my home. I found resonance in his descriptions of serene moments by the river and the enchanting pathways leading to Versailles, illustrating the timeless allure of Paris. Despite his financial constraints, Hemingway’s encounters with kindness in Paris echoed the warmth I experienced through my grandmother’s gestures in a foreign land. Moreover, I empathized with his acknowledgment of the city’s bleak seasons, reminiscent of my own less favorable times in Paris. Yet, even amidst its darkest days, Paris exuded a peculiar charm, reminiscent of snowy winters and mist-shrouded sunrises. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Through Hemingway’s narrative lens, I came to understand Paris not merely as a geographical entity but as a tapestry of diverse memories, each individual’s encounter unique yet interwoven. Though my memories of Paris remain etched in my heart, I am forever indebted to the richness it brought into my life. <em><strong>If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast. Yes, I am so lucky.</strong></em></p>\n<br>\n\n<p><em><strong>But Paris was a very old city and we were young and nothing was simple there, not even poverty, nor sudden money, nor the moonlight, nor right and wrong nor the breathing of someone who lay beside you in the moonlight.</strong></em></p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"-1\"><a href=\"#-1\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"\"></a></h3>","categories":["Beyond"],"tags":["BookReview"]},{"title":"Commodity Recap - Navigating Dollar Strength and Unique Drivers","url":"/2024/01/08/commodity_jan08/","content":"<h1 id=\"Summary\"><a href=\"#Summary\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Summary\"></a>Summary</h1><ul>\n<li><p><strong>Commodities experienced a broad impact from a stronger dollar or oversupply, with gold, silver, copper, zinc, nickel, tin, and soybean prices all affected.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Aluminum, however, deviated from this trend, as its retreat was attributed to strong investments from the UAE and PBOC support, showcasing a unique set of influencing factors.

This retreat was influenced by a resurgence in the US dollar, which exerted downward pressure on commodity prices. Additionally, profit-taking activities by commodity trading firms contributed to the dip in copper futures. The subdued demand from China further exacerbated the situation, marked by a fourth consecutive month of low Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) readings according to Caixin data. These factors collectively contributed to the weakening of copper prices in the market. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong>Aluminum retreats on supply enhancement, investments, and PBOC support.</strong>  Aluminum futures dropped below 2300 from the eight-month high of 2387 last week in 2023. The earlier surge was due to a bauxite supply disruption from Guinea, the world’s third-largest bauxite exporter. An explosion at a fuel depot in Guinea halted industrial activity, driving aluminum prices up. The recent retreat can be attributed to strong investments from the UAE in the infrastructure sector, alleviating investor concerns. Additionally, the People’s Bank of China’s (PBOC) policy to inject 350 billion into state banks is expected to bolster manufacturing activity, providing short-term support to aluminum prices.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong>Nickel futures dip on oversupply concerns.</strong> Nickel futures fell below $16,500 per tonne, nearing three-year lows, due to abundant supply from top producers—Indonesia, Philippines, and China. The International Nickel Study Group forecasts a surplus of 223,000 metric tons in 2023, with expectations of widening to 239,000 metric tons in 2024, emphasizing the persistent imbalance between supply and demand in the nickel market.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong>Tin dips on dollar strength, easing supply.</strong> Tin futures experienced a dip in the first week, influenced by a strengthening dollar and easing supply concerns from the previous year, following a three-month high of $25,680 reached on December 28th. Despite the decline, tin prices were upheld by the prolonged production halt in Myanmar’s Wa region since August, responsible for 70% of Myanmar’s output and a significant portion of China’s tin supply. With China compelled to seek alternative sources, the Republic of Congo became a primary supplier. However, adverse weather conditions and infrastructure challenges in Congo towards the end of the year hampered output, contributing to elevated tin prices in the market.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong>Lithium remained unchanged this week in such restocking season.</strong> Lithium carbonate prices, hitting CNY 97,500 per tonne in January, marked the lowest since August 2021, plummeting over 80% in the past year due to an escalating oversupply. Pessimism surrounding electric vehicle sales in China constrained lithium demand during the typical restocking season for battery manufacturers. Consequently, major industry players now project the next lithium deficit to emerge only in 2028, a sharp departure from earlier expectations. Previous investments aimed at increasing supply may propel the global carbonate equivalent supply to surge by 40% in 2024, as per UBS, intensifying the existing surplus.</p>\n<br>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Future</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Friday’s Close</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Weekly</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Monthly</th>\n<th align=\"center\">YTD</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Copper</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3.79</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-2.45</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1.87</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-3.21</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aluminum</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2274.50</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-4.59</td>\n<td align=\"center\">5.86</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-0.91</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Zinc</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2550.99</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-4.06</td>\n<td align=\"center\">5.00</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-15.66</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nickel</td>\n<td align=\"center\">15835</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-4.02</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-0.66</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-42.62</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tin</td>\n<td align=\"center\">24834</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-3.16</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3.20</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-1.04</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lithium</td>\n<td align=\"center\">96500</td>\n<td align=\"center\">0</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-2.03</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-80.80</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3 id=\"Agriculture\"><a href=\"#Agriculture\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Agriculture :\"></a>Agriculture :</h3><br>\n\n<p><strong>Soybean futures drop on oversupply.</strong> Soybean futures dropped to $12.6 per bushel in the first week, marking the lowest point in almost three months and extending a 15.1% loss from 2023 due to anticipated robust production. Despite weather challenges, Brazil is poised for a record-breaking soybean harvest. Additionally, Argentina is exploring the potential to double its soybean output, while Paraguay and Uruguay also indicate substantial increases.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong>Wheat futures rebound a little bit on buyer’s purchases.</strong> Wheat futures climbed above6.2 per bushel, recovering from the one-month low of 6 on January 3rd, following reports of new purchases from major consumers. The announcement that China was seeking another round of US wheat spurred buying activity from commodity funds. This potential purchase builds on a similar transaction at the end of November, which previously boosted the benchmark to $6.4.</p>\n<p><br><strong>Plam oil retreated.</strong> Malaysian palm oil futures hovered around MYR 3,700 per tonne as December’s end likely saw a decline in Malaysia’s palm oil inventories. The reduction can be attributed to diminished production caused by rainy weather and seasonal effects, as reported by a Reuters survey.</p>\n<br>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Future</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Friday’s Close</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Weekly</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Monthly</th>\n<th align=\"center\">YTD</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Soybeans</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1250.25</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-3.34</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-3.49</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-16.23</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wheat</td>\n<td align=\"center\">616.27</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-1.87</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2.72</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-17.11</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Palm Oil</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3682.00</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-1.05</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-0.99</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-9.13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"></td>\n<td align=\"center\"></td>\n<td align=\"center\"></td>\n<td align=\"center\"></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<hr>\n<br>\n","categories":["Markets"],"tags":["Commodity","Weekly Recap"]},{"title":"Book Review - Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned","url":"/2024/01/01/bookreview_jan08/","content":"<h1 id=\"\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"\"></a></h1><style>\n</style>\n\n<h2 id=\"Book-info\"><a href=\"#Book-info\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Book info\"></a>Book info</h2><br>\n\n<p>《Why Greatness Cannot Be Plannede》by Kenneth O. Stanley and Joel Lehman. This book challenges the conventional wisdom that setting specific goals is the key to achieving success. It introduces us to the concept of ‘novelty search,’ which essentially suggests that innovation and greatness might just stem from an unstructured exploration of our passions, rather than from chasing pre-set objectives. <strong><u>It’s like what we often say: Keep your passion alive and live your life without limits.</u></strong></p>\n<br>\n\n<h2 id=\"Content\"><a href=\"#Content\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Content\"></a>Content</h2><br>\n\n<p>This book starts by contrasting goal-oriented thinking with a more open-ended, passion-driven exploration. The initial chapters bring in various examples to illustrate how a non-objective-driven approach could be more effective, particularly in complex<br>and unpredictable scenarios. By Chapter 4, the book posits that having very specific goals might actually limit our potential and cause us to miss out on unforeseen opportunities. This is because overly complex and unprecedented goals are hard to measure, akin to predicting a path in a Markov chain - you can’t know the past routes, but you understand that certain prerequisites need to exist for the desired outcome. Essentially, only those who are well-prepared and knowledgeable can seize these opportunities when they arise.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>In the subsequent chapters, the authors liken this process to being a treasure hunter, constantly reveling in the discovery of new things. Life is full of ups and downs, and people often wish for a restart, to see things from a different perspective. Imagine if life was a game where you could restart infinitely – the fastest path might seem appealing, but it would also strip away the element of surprise and discovery. The book’s later chapters showcase real-world case studies where a novelty search approach led to significant breakthroughs across various fields. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong><u>The real message: Work hard, work smart, and with a bit of luck, you might meet serendipity.</u></strong></p>\n<br>\n\n<h2 id=\"Analysis-and-Critique\"><a href=\"#Analysis-and-Critique\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Analysis and Critique\"></a>Analysis and Critique</h2><br>\n\n<p>To be honest, I’m not entirely on board with the authors’ emphasis on the dichotomy between aimlessness and goal-setting. <strong><u>While I don’t advocate for a completely aimless approach, I do believe in setting broader, less specific long-term goals.</u></strong> For instance, the authors often mention that greatness is ‘accidental.’ In my view, the goals and methods we set are bound by our present understanding, rooted in past experiences. However, as we progress and evolve, our approaches may change, leading to outcomes that are different – and sometimes ‘accidental’ – compared to our original intentions. This suggests that we should aim for broad goals, remaining flexible in our journey.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Another example they use interpretation of natural evolution. While the authors see diversity as a way to avoid competition which he called “none goal for survival “, I believe it’s more about the broader goal of survival and reproduction. If we were to ‘restart’ life on Earth, humans might look completely different – like creatures from ‘Avatar’ or another alien species – as long as we’re suited to survive. Under this broad goal, species evolve and diversify. So, there’s always a goal, albeit not a highly specific one. Maybe It’s about pursuing happiness or value, but exploring and discovering like treasure hunters on a path towards the best possible outcomes.</p>\n<p><br><u><strong>In summary, I want to apply the concept of ‘golden mean’  for this book, I recommedate this book for a balance between short-term practical objectives and long-term, vague ambitions. It’s about holding onto your long-term goals while being open to abandoning unsuitable new ventures. The journey might be confusing or surprising at times, but that’s the essence of life.</strong> </u></p>\n<br>\n\n<p><u><strong>May you a journey filled with wonderful discoveries!</strong> </u></p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"-1\"><a href=\"#-1\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"\"></a></h3>","categories":["Beyond"],"tags":["BookReview"]},{"title":"Booklist for Jan","url":"/2024/01/01/booklist_jan/","content":"<h1 id=\"Top-Picks\"><a href=\"#Top-Picks\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Top Picks\"></a>Top Picks</h1><h1 id=\"Reade’s-choice\"><a href=\"#Reade’s-choice\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Reade’s choice\"></a>Reade’s choice</h1><ul>\n<li><p>《  Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned 》by Kenneth O.

On the flip side, a robust rebound was hindered by abundant stocks in major global warehouses. Data from the Shanghai Futures Exchange revealed an 8% increase in inventories in key Chinese warehouses, reaching 33,130 tonnes in the first week of January. The delicate balance between economic uncertainties and inventory levels continues to influence the trajectory of copper and raises cautious optimism about the commodity’s near-term performance.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong>Aluminum futures extended their decline to under $2,178 per tonne cuz of the resumed supply from Guinea.</strong>  The earlier surge last year was due to a bauxite supply disruption from Guinea, the world’s third-largest bauxite exporter.

The USDA’s upward revision of global wheat supply forecasts for the current marketing year, driven by increased production and beginning stocks, played a significant role. Ample stocks in Ukrainian silos, coupled with higher production in Russia reaching 91 million tonnes, just shy of the record set last year, contributed to an all-time high of 51 million tonnes available for export. This substantial surplus, combined with strong harvests in Canada and Australia, resulted in heightened export forecasts, solidifying the position of these key producers in the global wheat market.</p>\n<p><br><strong>Malaysian palm oil futures held steady around MYR 3,939 per tonne, marking the seventh consecutive session of gains and reaching a six-week high.</strong> This upward trajectory is attributed to the strength in rival edible oils on the Chicago Board of Trade and an increase in crude oil prices amid deepening Middle East tensions.

Each city offers a unique tapestry of attractions and characteristics, catering to a diverse range of tastes and interests. <strong><u>When what the city offer and individual preference match, affinity occurs. </u></strong></p>\n<br>\n\n<p>For some, the appeal lies in the vibrant energy of a bustling metropolis that never sleeps, making New York City their top choice. Others may be drawn to the tranquil beauty of natural scenery, leading them to favor destinations like Switzerland. Perhaps you’re enchanted by the timeless sophistication of old school charm, making London your preferred destination. Alternatively, the gritty, avant-garde atmosphere of Berlin might resonate with those who appreciate a sense of edgy authenticity. For those seeking festive excitement, the colorful carnival atmosphere of Brazil could be irresistible. If you’re captivated by wildlife and adventure, the untamed landscapes of Africa may call to you.

In terms of aesthetics, Paris achieves the pinnacle, from sensual aspects. </u></strong> </p>\n<br>\n\n<p>What skin brings in paris sensually, during the spring and autumn seasons, Paris offers a climate that feels just right - the perfect balance of temperature, humidity, and sunshine characteristic of its temperate maritime climate. It’s a comfortable sensation, devoid of the scorching heat of Southern European summers, the biting cold of Northern European winters, or the relentless rain of London or humid summers in Taiwan.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>What the eyes behold in Paris is a symphony of harmonious and cohesive Haussmannian architecture, the dappled shadows cast by plane trees lining the road to the Palace of Versailles, an abundance of artistic masterpieces waiting to be discovered in museums, and the sight of people leisurely strolling along the Seine, basking in the sunlight. Among them, you might spot impeccably dressed fashionistas clutching bouquets of flowers, adding to the city’s allure.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>What the ears are treated to in Paris are melodies drifting along the banks of the Seine, the electronic beats of parades in November, the exhilarating performances of firefighters on Bastille Day, and the spirited chants of protestors advocating for freedom and individuality.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>And what conversations in Paris entail are greetings of ‘Bonjour,’ ‘Bonne journée’ for a lovely day, and ‘joue contre joue’ the tender gesture of a kiss on the cheek upon meeting. In Paris, every aspect of the experience is carefully curated to evoke a sense of romance and enchantment, making it a city where love and beauty intertwine effortlessly.</p>\n<br>\n\n<h2 id=\"Where-Everything-Feels-Just-Right\"><a href=\"#Where-Everything-Feels-Just-Right\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Where Everything Feels Just Right\"></a>Where Everything Feels Just Right</h2><br>\n\n<p><strong><u>In essence, much like how people have a preferred temperature range for comfort, Paris provides an environment that feels just right, very suitable, and wonderfully relaxed. Paris benefits from a combination of exceptional natural conditions and intentional asthetic efforts. </u></strong></p>\n<br>\n\n<p>The city enjoys a favorable natural conditions that strike the ideal balance. Unlike some other regions, Paris is not plagued by extremes - it’s neither oppressively cold nor swelteringly hot. Its river, the Seine, is near perfect in size and speed, unlike the Danube in Hungary, which can feel a bit too rushing, or the smaller rivers in Amsterdam, which might seem miserly by comparison. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p>This climate also lends itself to a slight intoxication from the red wine that flows freely, inducing a gentle, tipsy state rather than the inebriation of strong spirits or the sobriety of light beers. When one is slightly intoxicated, they often become endearing and romantic, expressing affectionate words to friends and lovers that they may not say when sober. It’s this romantic ambiance that makes Paris forever enchanting.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>The presence of French plane trees, often found near the Palace of Versailles, further enhances Paris’s charm. These trees line the roadsides with just the right amount of shade and color, not overly dark green like the foliage in Taiwan during summer, nor the desolate barren trees seen in northern China during winter. Instead, they provide a perfect canopy, allowing just enough sunlight to filter through.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>On the other side, the city owes much of its charm to the high-quality aesthetics cultivated by Parisians. This includes the meticulous urban planning, the ever-evolving fashion scene, and the countless contributions from artists. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p>As for city planning for instance, Paris’s city planning is celebrated for its wide boulevards, uniform Haussmannian architecture, iconic landmarks, and abundant green spaces, collectively contributing to its unparalleled appeal. The expansive boulevards not only facilitate traffic flow but also provide a sense of openness and grandeur, inviting leisurely strolls and vibrant street life. The uniformity of Haussmannian architecture lends a timeless elegance to the cityscape, with limestone buildings and wrought-iron balconies adorning every corner. Coupled with iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and Notre-Dame Cathedral, Paris exudes an undeniable charm that captivates the imagination. Amidst this urban splendor, Paris boasts an array of green spaces, from the sprawling Tuileries Garden to the charming squares tucked away in residential neighborhoods, offering tranquil retreats amidst the bustling cityscape.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Let alone refined fashion taste of Parisians, Paris, renowned as the fashion capital of the world, sets the bar high when it comes to style and elegance. Parisians effortlessly exude a sense of chic sophistication, with their impeccable fashion sense and ability to effortlessly combine timeless classics with avant-garde trends. From iconic fashion houses to trendy boutiques, Paris offers a shopping experience like no other. High-end luxury brands line the streets of the Champs Elysées, while charming cobblestone alleyways hide hidden gems waiting to be discovered. Let alone the exquisite holiday decorations adorning the shops along the Champs Elysées, the interior decor of Galeries Lafayette, and the jewelry boutiques near the Liberation Monument. They strike the perfect balance of luxury without the overpowering scent of food on the ground floor, exuding only the elegance befitting the fashion capital of the world.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>In conclusion, the essence of Paris is encapsulated in moments of just right, like the feeling of basking in the warm sun in a tranquil park and leisurely strolling along the Seine River, taking in the picturesque street scenes on either bank. As the gentle breeze rustles through, sitting by the Seine, sipping wine, and listening to music as night descends, one witnesses couples lost in tender embraces amidst the shimmering lights scattered across the river. This isn’t merely a movable feast—it is called “<em><strong><u>Paris</u></strong></em>“.</p>\n<br>\n\n<h2 id=\"Paris-in-Literature-and-Film\"><a href=\"#Paris-in-Literature-and-Film\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Paris in Literature and Film\"></a>Paris in Literature and Film</h2><br>\n\n<p>In literature and film, Paris has served as a captivating backdrop that evokes a sense of nostalgia, romance, and escapism. Ernest Hemingway’s “A Moveable Feast” provides a glimpse into the author’s experiences during his time in Interwar France, where he found camaraderie among the cultural luminaries of the Lost Generation. For Hemingway, this period represented the pinnacle of literary inspiration, where good times were shared with like-minded individuals in the most enchanting of places.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Woody Allen’s “Midnight in Paris” beautifully captures the allure of Paris in the 1920s, painting scenes with a delicate brushstroke of golden light and shadow, imbuing the era with an air of luxury and tranquility. Through the protagonist’s encounters with Hemingway and his longing for the past, the film explores the human desire to escape reality and seek refuge in nostalgia. However, as the protagonist discovers, the past may not always live up to one’s idealized perceptions, and the present holds its own beauty and significance, present is something you can control. <em><strong>That’s what the present is. It’s a little unsatisfying because life’s a little unsatisfying.</strong></em> At the end of the movie, the right person stood in the rain, on his favorite street, and told him, <em><strong>“It doesn’t matter, I don’t mind getting wet.”</strong></em>  ,while his fiancee didn’t understand, <em><strong>“Paris is the most beautiful when it rains”</strong></em> </p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Despite the romanticized portrayal of Paris in literature and film, the city’s allure transcends mere fantasy. As an engineering student, I refrain from delving into personal subjective experiences, but the time spent in Paris remains etched in my heart. Paris, with its complexity and richness, is a city where nothing is simple, yet every experience holds a profound significance. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p><em><strong>But Paris was a very old city and we were young and nothing was simple there, not even poverty, nor sudden money, nor the moonlight, nor right and wrong nor the breathing of someone who lay beside you in the moonlight.</strong></em></p>\n<br>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"\"></a></h3>","categories":["Beyond"],"tags":["Culture","Country"]},{"title":"Econ Events - Why Turkey Against Sweden Joinning NATO","url":"/2024/01/27/econ_jan25/","content":"<br>\n\n<h2 id=\"Introduction\"><a href=\"#Introduction\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Introduction\"></a>Introduction</h2><br>\n\n<p>The intricate geopolitical landscape of Eurasia has been marked by historical complexities, <u><strong>strategic alliances, and enduring conflicts</strong></u>. </p>\n<p>Why do Türkiye and Hungary resist Sweden’s NATO accession? </p>\n<p>Why did Russia engage in war? </p>\n<p>What sparked the ignition of World War I? </p>\n<p>How has the tapestry of international relations in Eurasia experienced fragmentation and discord? </p>\n<p>In this exploration, we delve into the multifaceted dynamics that have shaped the geopolitical landscape of Eurasia over the years, <strong><u>from the establishment of NATO, wavering stance of nations, and conflicting interests.

This global conflict, fundamentally catalyzed by the ascension of Germany’s power, ushered in a substantial reconfiguration of geopolitical dynamics across Eurasia.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>The ignition point of World War I, rooted in the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Serbia, acted as a mere trigger in a sequence of events that had been set in motion long before. The prerequisites for this trigger were meticulously laid out, with two overarching factors steering the course: <strong><u>feasibility and conflicting interests between Germany and its neighboring nations.</u></strong></p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Firstly, the conflict of interests between Germany and its neighboring countries, particularly Britain and France, played a pivotal role. The colonialist pursuits of Britain and France had yielded substantial wealth, while Germany, along with Austria and Italy, found themselves marginalized in the imperialist division of resources. By the eve of World War I, Germany had already attained an industrial prowess surpassing even that of Britain, prompting strategic recalibration through war—an endeavor to reshape the geopolitical landscape and assert influence. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Secondly, the feasibility of war was facilitated by the rapid development of new weapons and equipment during that era, coinciding with the industrialization of several nations,especially german’s industrilization. This convergence created a volatile environment where military capabilities were advancing alongside geopolitical ambitions.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>More precisely for the 2 reasons, the next is around the conflcting interests and the expansion of armaments. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong><u>Germany ongoing conflicting interests with its neighboring nations. </u></strong> Germany, situated in Central Europe, has endured long period of division and historical strife, which is the best fertile land for nationalism. Before WW1, Britain’s expansive empire, where the sun never set, sought to protect its global interests. Germany, as a rising power yearning for its “land in the sun,” not only expanding in Europe but vying for overseas colonies, resources, and markets. The late colonial ambitions of Germany, lacking vast unclaimed territories, set the stage for conflict with existing colonial powers. The naval arms race between Britain and Germany further exacerbated tensions.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Simultaneously, economic struggles brewed between France and Germany, rooted in the geographic mismatch of iron-rich eastern France and coal-rich western Germany. Industrialists from both countries hoped to use a victorious war to unify the entire region under their own control.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Russia’s ambitions in the Balkans collided with Germany’s eastward expansion, while its maneuvers aimed at destabilizing the Austrian Empire exacerbated tensions. The intricate alliances and enmities weaved a complex geopolitical fabric, where the enemy of one’s enemy often became a reluctant friend. Complex alliances among Russia, Britain, France emerged, driven by shared enemies.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p><u><strong>Escalating Arms Race</strong></u>. In the years preceding the war, the acceleration of armaments reached a fever pitch. Major powers, including Germany, France, and Britain, intensified military preparations. In 1913, a major tax levied by Germany to raise special military expenditures amounted to fifty million pounds. At the same time, France extended the period of military service from two to three years, and Russia extended the period of military service by six months.  The exorbitant spending, coupled with an extension of military service and escalating naval construction plans, created an atmosphere where war seemed inevitable.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>The years preceding 1914 were marked by a series of crises, each capable of catalyzing a major war. Disputes over Morocco, Bosnia, Tripoli, and the Balkan Wars created tensions that, once overcome, birthed new conflicts. While the Balkans cannot be solely deemed the primary cause of World War I, the diplomatic deterioration in the region became a crucial factor. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p>In essence, the start of World War I was not an isolated incident but the culmination of a complex interplay of geopolitical forces, industrial advancements, and conflicting imperial ambitions once they achived their unification. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p>While my advocacy for peace is unwavering, I recognize that the world operates under the sway of strength rather than humanitarian ideals—often validated through the harrowing language of blood and tears. Germany’s engagement in two wars finds its roots in its formidable strength, a force that allowed it to compete on the global stage. In the pursuit of territorial ambitions, war, albeit destructive, presented itself as a straightforward means, as the acquisition of land was not up for negotiation.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Indeed, Germany has the capability to compete with other nations, even as a late comer. Germany’s rapid ascent as a late-developing country, surpassing the United Kingdom in economic scale and technological prowess, stems from the advantages inherent in being a latecomer. Yet, the drawbacks are unmistakable, particularly the tendency to be blinded by self-achievement, fostering a misguided belief in the inherent superiority of the nation. Germany, unlike other late-developing nations in the imitation stage for technology transfer and market expansion, led the world in science and invention. Moreover, its contributions to philosophy, academics, literature, and the arts, though constituting soft power, were globally renowned. The pride Germany felt during this era, though potentially harmful, was not entirely unfounded. Since then, many late-developing countries have failed to reach such heights, or even fall behind. As for its failure in World War, Germany’s geographical position posed both advantages and disadvantages. While its central location in Europe surrounded by major nations presented wartime challenges, it positioned Germany as a formidable trading power during peacetime, with access to both land and sea routes. The sea, however, imposed severe restrictions on Germany’s navy, highlighting the delicate balance between geographical advantages and wartime limitations.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>This international relations paradigm, deeply rooted in European history, posits that the rise and fall of nations are intimately linked to war. Any ascending power is perceived as a challenge, determined not by intentions but by strength—an inherent desire for development or dominating rights shared by all nations. </p>\n<br>\n\n<h2 id=\"Post-War\"><a href=\"#Post-War\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Post War\"></a>Post War</h2><br>\n\n<p><strong><u>After WW2, Post-Cold War as U.S. and Russia diverged strategically, with Russia initially leaning towards NATO amid disintegration but later pivoting to the East due to China’s rise, reshaping global power dynamics.</u></strong></p>\n<br>\n\n<h3 id=\"Post-Cold-War\"><a href=\"#Post-Cold-War\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Post-Cold War\"></a>Post-Cold War</h3><br>\n\n<p>Post cold war set the two major power seperately in East and West, so inevitably Sino-Soviet should deteriorate. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Between 1950 and 1963, often dubbed the “honeymoon period” of Sino-Soviet relations, both nations inked a series of agreements spanning trade, higher education, nuclear technology, and industry. The Soviet Union’s extensive support for China during this era included military involvement in the Korean War, where Chinese troops directly confronted the United Nations forces led by the United States. This shared military endeavor solidified China’s international alignment towards the Soviet Union, albeit temporarily. However, the euphoria dissipated in 1963, when official negotiations in Moscow between the Soviet and Chinese Communist Parties acknowledged irreconcilable differences. The ensuing tension escalated into border conflicts and military clashes in 1969.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Inevitably, after the rise of “revised Sovietism”,  The Soviet Union deployed millions of troops in strategic locations, attempting to create a Sino-Soviet buffer zone. Ambitious endeavors in regions such as Outer Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Afghanistan underscored the geopolitical complexity. Meanwhile, Vietnam, under Le Duan’s leadership, adopted a pro-Soviet, anti-Chinese stance. In response, China pursued diplomatic outreach to nations like Nepal and North Korea while fostering improved relations with Japan and the United States, particularly in the context of heightened tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The United States wanted to contain the power of the Soviet Union.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>The U.S. extended Marshall Plans in the Western world, emphasizing long-term interests and the establishment of a new world order. Concurrently, the Soviet Union wielded force to redraw territorial lines. <strong><u>Current complex interplay between China and US echoed historical patterns</u></strong>, creating a global landscape not entirely divorced from its past, yet distinct in its own right. As the geopolitical chessboard continues to evolve, echoes of the past resonate in the present, shaping the intricate dance of nations on the world stage.</p>\n<br>\n\n<h3 id=\"Soviet-Union’s-Disintegration\"><a href=\"#Soviet-Union’s-Disintegration\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Soviet Union’s Disintegration\"></a>Soviet Union’s Disintegration</h3><br>\n\n<p>Following the Soviet Union’s disintegration in 1991, Russia, under Yeltsin, faced economic challenges, political corruption, and regional issues like Chechen independence. Seeking stability, <strong><u>Yeltsin pursued a pro-Western strategy, expressing interest in joining NATO in 1991</u></strong>. However, Western “shock therapy” policies and perceived containment efforts strained relations. In 1999, NATO’s bombing campaign in Yugoslavia deepened tensions, leading to Russia’s failed attempt to join NATO.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Putin, succeeding Yeltsin, initially aimed to improve relations. In 2001, Russia reapplied to NATO, but under George W. Bush, the U.S. declared Russia a strategic competitor. NATO’s eastward expansion intensified, fueling Russo-NATO tensions. Despite Putin’s proposal in 2008 to join NATO, the U.S. remained skeptical, fearing impure motives. The Russo-Georgian War in 2008 further strained relations, dashing hopes of Russian NATO membership. NATO’s continual expansion, coupled with U.S. hesitations, exacerbated tensions. </p>\n<br>\n\n<h3 id=\"Rise-of-China\"><a href=\"#Rise-of-China\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Rise of China\"></a>Rise of China</h3><br>\n\n<p>NATO’s continuous expansion, coupled with Western hesitation and the rise of China, exacerbated tensions, ultimately contributing to recent conflicts, including the war between Russia and Ukraine. Therefore, the war in Ukraine is not a whim, but a dynamic change in the entire East and West.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>The onset of the Russo-Ukrainian war has spurred Finland and Sweden’s fervent desire to join NATO, indicating a shared perception of deteriorating international relations. Both nations, traditionally neutral, opt for NATO membership as a strategic move driven by the belief that a collective security framework is essential in the face of geopolitical uncertainties. This shift underscores a pragmatic calculation of common interests, as Finland and Sweden anticipate bilateral benefits within NATO rather than maintaining their traditional status as neutral countries. The quest for NATO membership reflects a strategic repositioning to navigate the changing dynamics of international relations amidst the Russo-Ukrainian conflict.</p>\n<br>\n\n<h2 id=\"Dependency-Theory\"><a href=\"#Dependency-Theory\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Dependency Theory\"></a>Dependency Theory</h2><br>\n\n<p>Examining historical patterns, the recurring challenge in Eurasia lies in <strong><u>constant conflicts between core and peripheral countries.</u></strong> Peripheral nations, like Turkey and Hungary, find themselves in a delicate position, far from the centers of power. The optimal strategy for these countries involves avoiding allegiance to a single side forcefully. Instead, it is advantageous to weaken both sides unless crucial to a specific party. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Loyalty levels in the relationships between core and peripheral countries fluctuate. Marginalized nations, less favored, inevitably experience exploitation, conflicts, and shifts in their stance. National interests, often unspoken at the individual level, create a web of ever-changing relationships between countries.<strong><u> In this arena, there are no eternal friends, only eternal interests. </u></strong> The dynamics, be it war or trade frictions, are devoid of morality, driven solely by the responsibility to millions of people. Peace, in this context, rests on a nation’s strength, not humanitarian ideals.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>In the quest for European hegemony, some countries find themselves stuck in the middle, distant from rising core nations, with their interests oscillating in uncertainty. Finland, wedged between Sweden and Tsarist Russia, or Poland and Ukraine, caught between Russia and Germany, exemplify this precarious positioning. Turkey, straddling Asia, Africa, and Europe, faces an even more complex geopolitical challenge. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong><u>Peripheral countries must strategically position themselves.</u></strong> Some, like Poland, lean towards pro-European and American stances, while others, like Finland and Sweden, traditionally preferred military neutrality. The Russo-Ukrainian war prompted Sweden to reconsider its alliance policy. </p>\n<p><br>Alternatively, countries like Turkey may choose a disruptive path to maximize their interests, echoing the historical sentiment captured in the TV series “Yes, Prime Minister” regarding British foreign policy’s goal of dividing Europe. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p>TV series lines as followed: Minister, Britain has had the same foreign policy objectives for at least the last 500 year to create a disunited Europe. In that cause, we have fought with the Dutch against the Spanish, with the Germans against the French, with the French and Italians against the Germans, and with the French against the Germans and Italians. Divide and rule , you see. We had to break the whole thing up, but that wouldn’t work, so we had to get inside. The foreign office is pro-Europe, because its really anti-Europe. The civil service was united in its desire to make sure that common market didn’t work, that’s why we were into it. If not, why are we pressing for an increase in the membership? Well, for the same reason, it is just like the United Nations in fact. The more members it has, the more arquments it can stir up, the more futile and impotent it becomes. What appalling cynicism, which is called diplomacy. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Characterizing pro-European actions as serving anti-European objectives may be biased. The European Union’s common market indeed brings substantial benefits to its member states during favorable conditions. It facilitates market flow and fosters market expansion, enhancing economic prosperity. However, the fairness of the global landscape is multifaceted, akin to Germany’s less-than-ideal geographical locationd during wartime, better than ideal during peacetime. To fully embrace the advantages of EU membership, member states must be prepared to make certain compromises when circumstances demand it.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Neutral countries, exemplified by Switzerland, employ an “armed neutrality strategy. Switzerland, nestled between France and Germany, has perfected the art of neutrality, acting as a crucial buffer during times of conflict. Its strategic positioning allowed it to facilitate military preparations for both Germany and France, offering refuge to French nobles and safeguarding their assets. Switzerland, aware of its military limitations, builds itself into a hedgehog. Its armed populace, universal military service, and strategic Alpine location create a formidable defense. This neutral stance allows Switzerland to act as a buffer, deterring potential invaders by making conquest more costly than the gains. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong><u>So, the reason for why sweden wanna join NATO and the opposition to Sweden’s NATO membership with Hungary and Turkey may rely on the both side intention of seeking greater interests.</u></strong> Excuses could be motivations may stem from response of Swedish comments for Hungary’s democracy or Turkey’s accusations against Sweden sheltering Kurdish militants. More specific, Turkey is negotiating for more F weapons from US for the vote of passing Sweden to joining NATO. The peripheral countries’ goal remains securing resources amidst core countries’ competition. Diplomatic relations and alliances may shift, demonstrating the pragmatic pursuit of national interests in a world dominated by the ebb and flow of geopolitical realities. </p>\n<br>\n\n<h2 id=\"Takeaways\"><a href=\"#Takeaways\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Takeaways\"></a>Takeaways</h2><br>\n\n<p><strong><u>Be more cautious for the potential escalating geopolitical issues.</u></strong> Examining the map, it’s evident that the small marginal countries at the crossroads of the Eurasian continent are aligning with distinct sides, representing broader Eastern and Western forces led by the United States and China. The looming possibility of a conflict between these major powers, whether initiated by the dominant United States or challenged by the latecomer China, increases as compromise becomes elusive. Both sides may need a war to set the new order. Current events, such as the Hamas-Israel conflict, tensions in the Red Sea, and disputes in the Taiwan Strait, suggest a path toward realization. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong><u>Peace and Love. </u></strong> While nobody wishes for war, history has shown that it’s an inevitable part of the human journey. In times of turmoil, peripheral countries prioritize their interests over emotions, ready to sever ties or forge close collaborations. The state machine, with its collective leadership, remains unwavering, serving the interests of millions. In this context, personal sentiments and moral unity take a back seat to the responsibility of individuals who contribute to the government, even as positions change. The country, acting as a rational entity, demands allegiance. For core countries, the pursuit of enduring love and peace remains paramount. Those in positions of influence bear the responsibility to extend kindness, having achieved their aspirations. A plea is made to contribute to global tranquility, recognizing the impact of their elevated positions on the world stage. In a world brimming with complexities, fostering peace becomes a shared imperative.</p>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3 id=\"Books-to-Read\"><a href=\"#Books-to-Read\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Books to Read\"></a>Books to Read</h3><p>Continental power and maritime checks and balances</p>\n<p>Why is Buddhism true?</p>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"-1\"><a href=\"#-1\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"\"></a></h3>","categories":["Markets"],"tags":["Events","Econ"]},{"title":"Commodity Recap - Navigating Red Sea Tentions and Oversupply Concerns","url":"/2024/01/14/commodity_jan14/","content":"<h1 id=\"Summary\"><a href=\"#Summary\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Summary\"></a>Summary</h1><ul>\n<li><p><strong>Commodities experienced diverse path, with gold and silver slightly increase for the concerns in Middle East, while base metals mostly continued its decline for concerns of oversupply</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Soybean futures hit a three-month low amid oversupply concerns.

Despite the People’s Bank of China injecting CNY 350 billion into other state policy banks, indicating continued government support for the economy, investor caution persists regarding China’s recovery. On the flip side, a robust rebound was hindered by abundant stocks in major global warehouses. Data from the Shanghai Futures Exchange revealed an 8% increase in inventories in key Chinese warehouses, reaching 33,130 tonnes in the first week of January. The delicate balance between economic uncertainties and inventory levels continues to influence the trajectory of copper and raises cautious optimism about the commodity’s near-term performance.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong>Aluminum futures extended their decline to under $2,250 per tonne</strong>  The earlier surge last year was due to a bauxite supply disruption from Guinea, the world’s third-largest bauxite exporter. An explosion at a fuel depot in Guinea halted industrial activity, driving aluminum prices up. The recent retreat can be attributed to strong investments from the UAE in the infrastructure sector, alleviating investor concerns. Additionally, the People’s Bank of China’s (PBOC) policy to inject 350 billion into state banks is expected to bolster manufacturing activity, providing short-term support to aluminum prices.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong>Nickel futures continued its decline for oversupply concerns.</strong> Nickel futures fell below $16,500 per tonne, nearing three-year lows, due to abundant supply from top producers—Indonesia, Philippines, and China. The International Nickel Study Group forecasts a surplus of 223,000 metric tons in 2023, with expectations of widening to 239,000 metric tons in 2024, emphasizing the persistent imbalance between supply and demand in the nickel market.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong>Tin continued its decline for oversupply concerns.</strong> Tin futures experienced a dip this week below 24,500, influenced by lingering expectations for stronger supply, following a three-month high of $25,680 reached on December 28th. Tin prices were upheld by the prolonged production halt in Myanmar’s Wa region since August, responsible for 70% of Myanmar’s output and a significant portion of China’s tin supply. With China compelled to seek alternative sources, the Republic of Congo became a primary supplier. However, adverse weather conditions and infrastructure challenges in Congo towards the end of the year hampered output, contributing to elevated tin prices in the market.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong>Lithium dip this week in such restocking season.</strong> Lithium carbonate prices, hitting CNY 95,500 per tonne this week, as the market somewhat found an equilibrium of ample supply and muted demand, which marked the lowest since August 2021, plummeting over 80% in the past year due to an escalating oversupply. Pessimism surrounding electric vehicle sales in China constrained lithium demand during the typical restocking season for battery manufacturers. Consequently, major industry players now project the next lithium deficit to emerge only in 2028, a sharp departure from earlier expectations. Previous investments aimed at increasing supply may propel the global carbonate equivalent supply to surge by 40% in 2024, as per UBS, intensifying the existing surplus.</p>\n<br>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Future</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Friday’s Close</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Weekly</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Monthly</th>\n<th align=\"center\">YOY</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Copper</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3.74</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-1.14</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-1.14</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-11.11</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aluminum</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2219</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-2.40</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3.69</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-14.49</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Zinc</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2513</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-1.93</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3.56</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-24.40</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nickel</td>\n<td align=\"center\">16189</td>\n<td align=\"center\">0.09</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-1.22</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-39.67</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tin</td>\n<td align=\"center\">24435</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-3.40</td>\n<td align=\"center\">0.31</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-8.87</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lithium</td>\n<td align=\"center\">95500</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-1.04</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-2.05</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-80.12</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3 id=\"Agriculture\"><a href=\"#Agriculture\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Agriculture :\"></a>Agriculture :</h3><br>\n\n<p><strong>Soybean futures drop on oversupply.</strong> Soybean futures dropped to $12.2 per bushel this week, marking the lowest point in almost three months and extending a 15.1% loss from 2023 due to anticipated robust production. Despite weather challenges, Brazil is poised for a record-breaking soybean harvest. Additionally, Argentina is exploring the potential to double its soybean output, while Paraguay and Uruguay also indicate substantial increases.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong>Wheat futures saw a decline, slipping below $5.95 per bushel in January, marking the lowest point in over a month.</strong> The drop is attributed to sustained expectations of robust global supply. The USDA’s upward revision of global wheat supply forecasts for the current marketing year, driven by increased production and beginning stocks, played a significant role. Ample stocks in Ukrainian silos, coupled with higher production in Russia reaching 91 million tonnes, just shy of the record set last year, contributed to an all-time high of 51 million tonnes available for export. This substantial surplus, combined with strong harvests in Canada and Australia, resulted in heightened export forecasts, solidifying the position of these key producers in the global wheat market.</p>\n<p><br><strong>Malaysian palm oil futures held steady around MYR 3,856 per tonne, marking the seventh consecutive session of gains and reaching a five-week high.</strong> This upward trajectory is attributed to the strength in rival edible oils on the Chicago Board of Trade and an increase in crude oil prices amid deepening Middle East tensions. The weekly performance reflects a nearly 4% jump, driven by growing speculation that India, a major buyer, may escalate palm oil purchases due to concerns over the availability of sunflower and soybean oils amid tensions in the Red Sea. The confluence of global factors and regional demand fears continues to propel Malaysian palm oil futures to higher levels.</p>\n<br>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Future</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Friday’s Close</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Weekly</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Monthly</th>\n<th align=\"center\">YOY</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Soybeans</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1223</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-2.65</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-7.79</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-19.95</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wheat</td>\n<td align=\"center\">596</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-3.25</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-1.53</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-19.87</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Palm Oil</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3856</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4.73</td>\n<td align=\"center\">5.07</td>\n<td align=\"center\">0.39</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<hr>\n<br>\n","categories":["Markets"],"tags":["Commodity","Weekly Recap"]},{"title":"Econ Events - Why bullfighting facing challenges in Spain","url":"/2023/01/31/econ_jan31/","content":"<div class=\"hbe hbe-container\" id=\"hexo-blog-encrypt\" data-wpm=\"Oh, this is an invalid password.

This candidate champions ideas such as the dollarization of the economy, drastic cuts in state spending, opposition to established norms like sex education and legal abortion, legalization of organ selling, relaxation of gun control, and even drug legalization. In many countries, such propositions might be dismissed as too radical or contentious. Yet, in Argentina, this very set of proposals has propelled someone to the presidency. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p>The question then arises: Why would the people of Argentina choose such a leader? It’s a mistake to dismiss this decision as irrational. As an advocate for the rational actor hypothesis, I propose to delve into the complex web of reasons behind Javier Milei’s ascent to power. What does his victory reveal about the current state of Argentina’s society, economy, and political landscape? Let’s explore the underlying factors that made Milei’s presidency not just possible, but perhaps even inevitable. <strong><u>One sentence to summerize: when population are sick of both parties, they tend to vote for the unorthdox president who may have potential to rescue their life with radical proposal, including Argentina, Ukraine, etc. </u></strong> </p>\n<br>\n\n<h2 id=\"Argentina’s-Tumultuous-Path\"><a href=\"#Argentina’s-Tumultuous-Path\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Argentina’s Tumultuous Path\"></a>Argentina’s Tumultuous Path</h2><br>\n\n<p>Tracing Argentina’s path to its current state requires a journey back in time, well before World War II. Known as the <strong>World’s Breadbasket</strong>, Argentina boasted vast pampas, fertile lands, and a climate favorable for agriculture. During this era, its economy rivaled that of Britain and the emerging power of the United States.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>However, despite avoiding direct involvement in World Wars I and II, Argentina couldn’t escape economic turmoil. The withdrawal of British investments, which constituted a significant portion of its economy, exacerbated <strong>Argentina’s financial woes</strong>. The country grappled with incomplete industrialization, relying heavily on imported agricultural machinery from Britain and the United States,highlighting the country’s dependency on foreign technology.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>When the populace struggles to meet basic needs such as food, a shift in governance becomes almost a certainty, mostly during financial crisis.  The ensuing era saw the rise of military governments. This period was marked by a strategic choice between authoritarianism and supporting unions to ensure political stability. The latter option was notably visible during <strong>Peronism</strong>. The government increased public spending and overhauled infrastructure for the populace’s benefit, but these measures led to tight national finances and subsequent money printing. By around 1950, inflation in Argentina soared to 40%, outpacing wage growth, which lagged behind at 30%. This raises the question: Is the pursuit of social welfare without a robust economic foundation genuinely sustainable?</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Successive governments post-Peronism continued to grapple with this <strong>dilemma</strong>, often opting to enhance national welfare to secure votes, despite the burgeoning fiscal deficit. This deficit was frequently addressed through increasing foreign debt. From 1990 to 2022, Argentina’s total M2 money supply skyrocketed from 800 million to 134 trillion pesos. Repaying this debt through inflation led to extreme economic turbulence, culminating in a staggering 20,000% inflation rate post the Falklands War in 1982.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Over these tumultuous 70 years, Argentina’s socio-economic landscape was primed for a radical change. This set the stage for the rise of Javier Milei, a candidate who capitalized on the public’s growing discontent, eventually being elected as the new president with 56% support.”</p>\n<br>\n\n<h2 id=\"The-Roots-of-Milei’s-Triumph\"><a href=\"#The-Roots-of-Milei’s-Triumph\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Roots of Milei’s Triumph\"></a>The Roots of Milei’s Triumph</h2><br>\n\n<p>Javier Milei is far from your typical politician. His eclectic background as a DJ, radio commentator, and football player, coupled with his forthright criticism of societal norms, government inaction, and Argentina’s long-standing economic woes, sets him apart. <strong>Milei’s direct and unorthodox approach has resonated deeply with many Argentinians, his policies striking a chord in a society yearning for change.</strong> His solutions to Argentina’s challenges were radical yet straightforward: Rising Inflation? Response: Abolish the peso. Government Inefficiency? Response: Disband the government. Stagnant Wages? Response: Eliminate taxes. Economic Downturn? Response: Privatize state-owned assets. Social Security and Healthcare Concerns? Response: Legalize prostitution and organ selling, while upholding gun rights and opposing abortion.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>These policies, while controversial, seemed to offer a direct and immediate response to Argentina’s deep-rooted problems. This boldness in policy-making positioned Milei not just as a leader but as a potential savior in the eyes of many. Was Milei’s election a surprise? Not really. It appears more as a logical outcome under the circumstances. Faced with persisting errors in governance, it seems the electorate preferred to entrust the nation’s future to an unconventional figure, embracing the potential for unforeseen outcomes over the continuation of known failures.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Wait a second, Milei’s approach echoes that of Margaret Thatcher during the Falklands War era. Thatcher’s policies, focused on cutting social welfare, privatizing state assets, and boosting economic efficiency, were transformative for the UK, albeit with mixed outcomes. refine this expression :Mrs. Thatcher was the <strong>savior of the capitalists</strong> of that era, but she was also the <strong>living judge of the miserable people</strong>. Similarly, Milei’s strategies might spur short-term enterprise growth in Argentina, akin to Thatcher’s impact in the UK. However, there are concerns about the long-term consequences: increased wealth disparity, rising unemployment, diminished trade union rights, and potential social unrest.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong>Power abhors a vacuum.</strong> As the government recedes from key sectors under Milei’s administration, unregulated capital, conglomerates, and even underground organizations might fill the void. The freedom to bear arms, as proposed by Milei, could instill a semblance of order, albeit outside the traditional governmental framework.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>What lies ahead for Argentina and its people under Milei’s leadership remains uncertain.

hawkish stance impacted, while mixed corporate results influenced a modest stock market gain.</strong> The Brazilian real weakened to around 4.99 per USD by Friday, driven by a more hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve. Latest inflation data exceeded the BCB’s upper tolerance band at 4.51%, indicating upside risks. Additionally, Brazil’s trade surplus in January missed market expectations, exacerbating an unexpected decline in foreign direct investment from December and limiting foreign currency inflows. In the stock market, the Ibovespa secured a modest gain of 0.5% for the week, supported by mixed corporate results. Despite a 35% decline in fourth-quarter profits, Vale announced dividends exceeding R$11 billion, with its shares ending slightly higher by 0.3%, helping offset the impact of disappointing earnings reports on the index. However, state-owned oil giant Petrobras led the energy sector downward with a 0.5% loss, influenced by lower oil prices.</p>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3 id=\"Mexico\"><a href=\"#Mexico\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Mexico\"></a>Mexico</h3><p><strong>Mexico, the peso depreciated amid anticipation of a central bank rate cut.</strong> The Mexican peso weakened to around 17.11 per USD by Friday, reaching a one-week low amid growing expectations of an imminent rate cut by the Mexican central bank. On Thursday, Mexico’s government reported consumer price inflation for the first half of February, surprising to the downside. Headline inflation declined to a year-over-year rate of 4.5%, down from 4.9% in the previous reading, while core inflation fell to 4.6%, compared to 4.8% previously. The main stock market index in Mexico (IPC Mexico) has decreased by 726 points or 1.27% since the beginning of 2024.</p>\n<br>\n\n<h3 id=\"Argentina\"><a href=\"#Argentina\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Argentina\"></a>Argentina</h3><p>The USD to ARS exchange rate increased by 0.47% for the week as more harkish stance from US fed reserve goveror.

India’s composite Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) exceeded 60 for the second consecutive month in February, reinforcing the robust 7.3% growth achieved in FY2023. This stellar performance outpaced other major economies, fostering a bullish environment and attracting foreign exchange inflows. Foreign investment into India also benefited from investors reallocating funds away from China, propelling the Sensex towards record highs and driving down the yield on the 10-year Government Securities (G-Sec) to multi-month lows. Robust economic growth provided further support to the rupee, offering the RBI flexibility to maintain its hawkish stance.</p>\n<br>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Markets</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Friday’s Close</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Weekly</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Monthly</th>\n<th align=\"center\">YOY</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>USD&#x2F;INR</td>\n<td align=\"center\">82.85</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-0.19</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-0.33</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-0.05</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SENSEX</td>\n<td align=\"center\">73143</td>\n<td align=\"center\">0.99</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2.93</td>\n<td align=\"center\">23.00</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<br>\n\n<h3 id=\"EU\"><a href=\"#EU\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"EU :\"></a>EU :<br><br></h3><h3 id=\"Russia\"><a href=\"#Russia\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Russia\"></a>Russia</h3><p><strong>The ruble steadied near 93 per USD amid EU sanctions concerns.</strong> The Russian ruble steadied near 93 per USD, hovering close to a two-month low reached on February 19th. This was primarily influenced by news of the 13th package of EU sanctions, anticipated for approval by the end of the week. Stricter sanctions could potentially halt loading activities and exacerbate the fuel production and export constraints due to Ukrainian attacks on Russian refineries, intensifying the existing capacity crisis. Additionally, the Central Bank of Russia revised its medium-term forecast for the current account from $75 billion to $42 billion in 2024, indicating a significant decline in foreign currency inflows. The ruble-based MOEX Russia index closed 3.2% lower on Friday as investors weighed the risks associated with the impending sanctions package from the EU and the US ahead of the national holiday.</p>\n<br>\n\n<h3 id=\"Turkey\"><a href=\"#Turkey\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Turkey\"></a>Turkey</h3><p><strong>Turkey’s lira held steady amidst central bank decisions.</strong> Turkey’s lira remained unchanged throughout the week amidst a balancing act between the hawkish stance of Türkiye’s central bank and the US Federal Reserve. In its scheduled monetary policy meeting on Thursday, Türkiye’s central bank maintained its key interest rate, the one-week repo auction rate, at 45.0%, as widely expected.

Headline inflation, standing at 4.62% in December, surpassed market expectations of 4.54%. While the central bank is anticipated to implement its fifth consecutive 50bps cut this month, the persistent risk of upside price growth may prompt policymakers to temper their dovish signals, leading to a potentially more cautious approach to Brazilian disinflation. This shift in expectations toward a more hawkish stance was evident in the currency market, where the real appreciated by 0.42% against the US dollar this week. Additionally, for the long term, Brazil’s currency exhibited resilience, attributed to the country’s record trade surplus of $98.8 billion in 2023, marking a substantial 60.6% increase from the previous year. This surplus, driven by expanded exports in agriculture and extractive industries, has not only bolstered foreign currency inflows but also contributed to the strength of the real. As Brazil navigates these economic challenges, policymakers face a delicate balance in responding to both contractionary forces and inflationary pressures.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>The Ibovespa, however, experienced a 0.7% loss, initially influenced by lower oil prices earlier in the week. The later disruption of commercial routes in the Red Sea due to U.S. and UK airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen led to a surge in oil prices by week-end, benefitting Petrobras and ultimately contributing to a 0.3% increase in the Ibovespa.</p>\n<br>\n\n<h3 id=\"Mexico\"><a href=\"#Mexico\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Mexico\"></a>Mexico</h3><p><strong>In Mexico, mirroring the trend in Brazil, the Mexican peso strengthened, surpassing the 16.86 per USD level.</strong> December’s inflation data revealed a month-over-month headline inflation of 0.7%, with a year-over-year rate of 4.7%, slightly exceeding expectations. The central bank is anticipated to maintain a vigilant stance against broader inflation, signaling a reluctance for immediate interest rate cuts until sustained signs of longer-lasting disinflation emerge. Concurrently, the World Bank adjusted Mexico’s growth projection for 2024, elevating it from 1.9% to a more optimistic 2.6%. This adjustment underscores the resilience of the Mexican economy in the face of aggressive rate hikes in the previous year, providing a positive outlook for the nation’s economic trajectory.<br></p>\n<p>Recent economic indicators further underscored the resilience of the Mexican economy, with business confidence reaching a ten-year high.

Despite numerous rejections and setbacks, Brad’s perseverance and positive attitude help him secure a teaching position.</p>\n<br>\n\n<h2 id=\"Personal-Takeaway\"><a href=\"#Personal-Takeaway\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Personal Takeaway\"></a>Personal Takeaway</h2><br>\n\n<p><strong><u>Everyone is born with unique resource endowment. We must accept that not everyone starts with the same advantages, and we must face many difficulties because of these differences. However, by finding N+1 solutions to overcome these challenges, you will become a wonderful, warm-hearted people. </u></strong></p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong>Accept that luck may not be on your side at birth.</strong> Everyone is born with different types of resource endowment—physical, social, and economic. As a result, life is inherently unequal from the start. Some people may face physical disabilities, others may struggle with intelligence, while some might face gender biases or economic hardships. These disparities mean that fairness is not guaranteed. These disparities are not personal failures but rather a matter of differing luck or circumstance. Take Brad Cohen, for example. He was born with Tourette Syndrome, which causes him to make involuntary noises. Despite his desire to fit in and be like everyone else, his condition presents ongoing challenges. This is not his fault; it is simply a part of his resource endowment.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong>Being different can lead to being treated differently by the world.</strong> Such a broader reality: others’ reactions, while sometimes hurtful, reflect the natural response to differences. Sometimes, people just misunderstand, which is natural. Whether it’s discrimination based on gender, laughter at physical disabilities, lack of confidence due to poverty, or unkindness towards LGBTQ individuals, these reactions are part of the process of navigating a world that may not always be fair. Cohen, for example, avoided attending his students’ funeral to avoid causing any discomfort. When Brad Cohen went golfing with his brother, his Tourette Syndrome caused him to make involuntary noises, leading to him being asked to leave.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>But this does not affect Cohen from being a warm and humorous person.When others speak up for him on the golf course, he responds with a cheerful, <em><strong>“It’s okay, maybe next year.”</strong></em> When people mistakenly think his noises are from a dog, he jokingly says, <em><strong>“Yes, I have a sheepdog.”</strong></em> Such optimism is of course the best, but it’s natural to feel upset or frustrated sometimes, give yourself permission to be human. However, these feelings should be seen as part of the journey, not the end goal. When encountering judgment or misunderstanding, you might find solace in responding with sincerity and humor, such as saying, <em><strong>“I’ve seen that look a lot. It’s a look of envy, as if they’re wondering how they can make cool noises like I do.”</strong></em></p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong>When the going gets tough, the tough get going.</strong> There are countless ways to address the challenges life throws at you. Improving yourself and acknowledging your weaknesses is crucial, but don’t forget that you possess more than just these limitations. Some people practice double ollies with a small fishing rod, others put on makeup in a taxi before interviews, and some train for basketball while barefoot. Seek out environments that align with your strengths and needs. When Brad Cohen faced rejection from a school that asked him to control his tics to fit in, he responded with grace: <em><strong>“I really want this so badly, but thank you for your time.”</strong></em> He then continued his search and applied to over 20 schools.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Give yourself at least 20 chances to try something new, to overcome your fears, and to persist before considering giving up. Whether you fear public speaking, struggling with exams, facing challenges in interviews, or encountering difficulties in learning an instrument or relationships, don’t be discouraged. When you feel like giving up, try one more time. Experiment with different methods, positions, environments, or even relationships. The probability of success may not always be high, but expanding your opportunities and remaining patient can lead you to the right place.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>You have a long life ahead of you. Be patient and persistent. Eventually, you will find a position or a person who values you for who you are. You might encounter a supportive supervisor who says, <em><strong>“We are proud to teach our kids to overcome any obstacles in their lives. If we’re going to talk the talk, we need to walk the walk. Welcome!”</strong></em> Similarly, you might find someone who says, <em><strong>“I do not mind the noise you make when compared to other guys’ noise, you know, the braggers, loud-talkers, you know, like egocentric, humor-challenged idiots. Your noise doesn’t bother me at all, as long as you keep me laughing.”</strong></em> </p>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<p><em><strong>I don’t want to be different, but I am. And I have to learn to accept it. Every time someone said ‘no’ to me, it just made me more determined to prove them wrong.

This week, ASML achieved a significant milestone by reaching the ‘first light’ landmark on its new EUV lithography system. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Additionally, India’s approval of a $15.2 billion investment in chip manufacturing and Mobileye’s positive conference commentary led to a surge in shares, gaining over 10% intraday. Despite a recent share value decline, Mobileye’s EyeQ technology, capable of complex vision tasks, has been adopted by more than 50 vehicle manufacturers. From the lastest news, the vast majority of excess inventory would be cleared out, which includes a significant number of customer commitments they’ve received for the second quarter.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong>Weekly Loser:</strong></p>\n<br>\n\n<p>ChargePoint reported a Q4 revenue 24% lower than the previous year, attributing the decline to slowing EV adoption impacting commercial sales. Quarterly revenue fell to $115.8 million from $152.8 million, resulting in a 4% intraday share price decline.

:</h3><br>\n\n<p><strong>TSM and ASML emerged as top performers among EV suppliers this week.</strong> In this week’s portfolio, TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) and ASML stand out among EV suppliers, showcasing impressive gains of 12% and 6% respectively. TSM’s Q4 data surpassed expectations, reporting a robust fourth-quarter revenue of $20.10 billion, as calculated by Reuters.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong>Looking ahead to TSMC’s 2024 outlook, there is optimism fueled by the anticipated recovery in chip demand.</strong> This resurgence is attributed to smartphone and PC manufacturers seeking to replenish their diminishing inventories. TSMC’s revenue growth in 2024 is expected to be driven by the ramp-up of 3nm technology, expansion in CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate) technology, and the overall recovery in demand. Additionally, TSMC aims to maintain a solid market share, contributing to its positive outlook.</p>\n<br>\n\n<h3 id=\"Biweekly-Catalyst-Highlights-1\"><a href=\"#Biweekly-Catalyst-Highlights-1\"
