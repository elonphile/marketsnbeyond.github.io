Despite numerous rejections and setbacks, Brad's perseverance and positive attitude help him secure a teaching position.\n\n<br>\n\n## Personal Takeaway\n\n<br>\n\n**<u>Everyone is born with unique resource endowment. We must accept that not everyone starts with the same advantages, and we must face many difficulties because of these differences. However, by finding N+1 solutions to overcome these challenges, you will become a wonderful, warm-hearted people. </u>**\n\n<br>\n\n**Accept that luck may not be on your side at birth.** Everyone is born with different types of resource endowment—physical, social, and economic. As a result, life is inherently unequal from the start. Some people may face physical disabilities, others may struggle with intelligence, while some might face gender biases or economic hardships. These disparities mean that fairness is not guaranteed. These disparities are not personal failures but rather a matter of differing luck or circumstance. Take Brad Cohen, for example. He was born with Tourette Syndrome, which causes him to make involuntary noises. Despite his desire to fit in and be like everyone else, his condition presents ongoing challenges. This is not his fault; it is simply a part of his resource endowment.\n\n<br>\n\n**Being different can lead to being treated differently by the world.** Such a broader reality: others’ reactions, while sometimes hurtful, reflect the natural response to differences. Sometimes, people just misunderstand, which is natural. Whether it's discrimination based on gender, laughter at physical disabilities, lack of confidence due to poverty, or unkindness towards LGBTQ individuals, these reactions are part of the process of navigating a world that may not always be fair. Cohen, for example, avoided attending his students' funeral to avoid causing any discomfort. When Brad Cohen went golfing with his brother, his Tourette Syndrome caused him to make involuntary noises, leading to him being asked to leave.\n\n<br>\n\nBut this does not affect Cohen from being a warm and humorous person.When others speak up for him on the golf course, he responds with a cheerful, ***“It’s okay, maybe next year.”*** When people mistakenly think his noises are from a dog, he jokingly says, ***“Yes, I have a sheepdog.”*** Such optimism is of course the best, but it's natural to feel upset or frustrated sometimes, give yourself permission to be human. However, these feelings should be seen as part of the journey, not the end goal. When encountering judgment or misunderstanding, you might find solace in responding with sincerity and humor, such as saying, ***“I’ve seen that look a lot. It’s a look of envy, as if they’re wondering how they can make cool noises like I do.”***\n\n<br>\n\n**When the going gets tough, the tough get going.** There are countless ways to address the challenges life throws at you. Improving yourself and acknowledging your weaknesses is crucial, but don't forget that you possess more than just these limitations. Some people practice double ollies with a small fishing rod, others put on makeup in a taxi before interviews, and some train for basketball while barefoot. Seek out environments that align with your strengths and needs. When Brad Cohen faced rejection from a school that asked him to control his tics to fit in, he responded with grace: ***\"I really want this so badly, but thank you for your time.\"*** He then continued his search and applied to over 20 schools.\n\n<br>\n\nGive yourself at least 20 chances to try something new, to overcome your fears, and to persist before considering giving up. Whether you fear public speaking, struggling with exams, facing challenges in interviews, or encountering difficulties in learning an instrument or relationships, don’t be discouraged. When you feel like giving up, try one more time. Experiment with different methods, positions, environments, or even relationships. The probability of success may not always be high, but expanding your opportunities and remaining patient can lead you to the right place.\n\n<br>\n\nYou have a long life ahead of you. Be patient and persistent. Eventually, you will find a position or a person who values you for who you are. You might encounter a supportive supervisor who says, ***\"We are proud to teach our kids to overcome any obstacles in their lives. If we’re going to talk the talk, we need to walk the walk. Welcome!\"*** Similarly, you might find someone who says, ***\"I do not mind the noise you make when compared to other guys' noise, you know, the braggers, loud-talkers, you know, like egocentric, humor-challenged idiots. Your noise doesn't bother me at all, as long as you keep me laughing.\"*** \n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n***I don't want to be different, but I am. And I have to learn to accept it. Every time someone said 'no' to me, it just made me more determined to prove them wrong. Every 'no' has pushed me to find a way to make a 'yes'.*** \n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\nThis is a true story. I hope that all the Cohens in all corners of the world will have a really wonderful day! At least someone in the distance wants to give you a big hug when you are wronged. May your journey be filled with resilience, joy, and the fulfillment of your dreams!\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n## Other Materials\n\n<br>\n\n **\"The Pursuit of Happyness\"** (2006): This film tells the inspiring true story of Chris Gardner, who overcomes homelessness and personal struggles to achieve success and provide a better life for his son.\n\n<br>\n\n**\"Homeless to Harvard: The Liz Murray Story\"** (2003): This film tells the remarkable story of Liz Murray, who rises from a life of homelessness to achieve academic success at Harvard University.\n\n<br>\n\n**\"The Shawshank Redemption\"** (1994): A classic story of hope and perseverance, following the journey of a man wrongfully imprisoned who finds freedom through resilience.\n\n<br>\n\n**Forrest Gump\"** (1994): This film chronicles the extraordinary life of a man with a simple outlook who unwittingly influences historical events through his perseverance.\n\n<br>\n\n**\"The Blind Side\"** (2009): The true story of a young man from a disadvantaged background who is taken in by a caring family and goes on to succeed in football and life.\n\n<br>\n\n**Songs by Imagine Dragons**: Believer, Whatever It Takes, Thunder, Demons, Symphony\n\n---\n\n### \n","tags":["MovieReview"],"categories":["Beyond"]},{"title":"Markets Recap - Semiconductor Tensions and IT Outage Send Ripples Through US and EU Markets; Mixed Results in Asia","url":"/2024/07/20/macro_jul20/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **This week, the US market experienced mixed results with significant losses in growth stocks due to semiconductor tensions and a global IT outage, while value stocks saw gains amid political optimism, and bond yields fluctuated in response to positive economic data and IT. EU stock and bond markets mirrored the US, with stocks falling and bond yields rising amid trade tensions and ECB decisions.**\n\n- **Asian markets experienced mixed results this week, with Japan's stock market declining due to concerns over tighter US restrictions and weaker economic forecasts, while Chinese stocks outperformed on positive updates from the Third Plenary Session and resilience amid a global IT outage.** \n\n- **The dollar strengthened amid a global IT outage and risk-off sentiment, while the yen steadied on suspected intervention, oil prices fell due to ceasefire hopes and a stronger dollar, and gold declined as expectations for a Fed rate cut remained high.** \n\n<br>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n### US Market : <br><br>\n\n**This week, the stock market ended mixed, with the S&P 500 and NASDAQ declining by 1.97% and 3.98%, respectively.** **The losses were mainly due to rising tensions between the US and China in the semiconductor sector and a global IT outage on Friday.** Growth stocks, particularly in the chip sector, suffered after news that the Biden administration was considering strict export restrictions on China. Major chip stocks experienced significant drops. The Friday IT outage was reportedly caused by an update from CrowdStrike (down 11.1%) that disrupted Microsoft's (down 0.7%) Windows systems. In contrast, value stocks outperformed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 0.72%. This was partly driven by the increasing likelihood of a Republican sweep in the upcoming November elections, which seemed to favor value stocks. The possibility of relaxed banking regulations provided a boost to the value-oriented financial sector.\n\n<br>\n\n**The bond market reacted to positive economic data and comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S.** Treasury note fell as inflation concerns eased, but spiked on Friday due to the Microsoft disruption. Powell stated, \"Now that inflation has come down and the labor market has indeed cooled off, we’re going to be looking at both mandates. They’re in much better balance.\" The global IT outage on Friday further contributed to the week's unease, affecting services from airlines to banks.\n\n<br>\n\n**Economic Data** \n\n- Retail sales, excluding the volatile gas and auto segments, jumped 0.8% in June, well above expectations and the highest increase since January 2023\n\n- Building permits rose by 3.4% in June, surpassing expectations and ending three consecutive monthly declines\n\n- The Federal Reserve reported on Wednesday that industrial production increased by 0.6% in June, roughly double the estimates\n\n- Weekly jobless claims increased to 243,000, reaching a nine-month high, primarily due to seasonal factors\n\n- Manufacturing activity in the US Mid-Atlantic region expanded more than expected in July, driven by a surge in new orders\n\n<br>\n\n| Index   | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY   |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| S&P 500 | 5505           | -1.97  | 0.58    | 21.39 |\n| DJIA    | 40288          | 0.72   | 2.95    | 14.37 |\n| Nasdaq  | 19523          | -3.98  | -1.16   | 26.23 |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### EU Market :<br><br>\n\n**The stock market ended lower this week, primarily due to the ECB decision and trade tensions between the US and China.** The STOXX Europe 600 Index fell by 2.68%. Germany’s DAX dropped 3.07%, France’s CAC 40 Index lost 2.46%, and Italy’s FTSE MIB declined by 1.05%. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index decreased by 1.18%. Traders retreated from big tech stocks amid expectations of interest rate cuts and concerns over US trade restrictions on China, with Infineon losing 3%, for example. The market was also impacted by slowing Chinese economic growth and ongoing political uncertainty in France. LVMH fell 6.3%, Hermes shed 5%, and Kering declined by 7.1% over the week.\n\n<br>\n\n**In the bond market, movements mirrored those in the US, especially on Friday.** The yield on the UK's 10-year Gilt increased by 6 basis points this week as investors sought safety amid a global IT outage linked to cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. Additionally, the ECB kept its key interest rates unchanged at 3.75%, as expected. The ECB stated it would not precommit to any rate path and emphasized that economic data would guide its decisions. ECB President Christine Lagarde remarked that a move in September was \"wide open,\" and noted that risks to economic growth were \"tilted to the downside,\" adding to concerns over the EU's economic health.\n\n<br>\n\n**Economic Data**\n\n- UK's unemployment rate unchanged at 4.4% in May as expected\n\n- UK inflation steady at 2% in June, reducing chance of rate cut\n\n- Spain inflation eases to 3.4% in June\n\n- France inflation eases to 2.2% in June\n\n- UK's GDP expands 0.4% in May\n\n- Industrial production in the euro area in May fell 0.6% sequentially, declining for the first time since January, according to Eurostat\n\n<br>\n\n| Index       | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY   |\n| ----------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| STOXX 600   | 510            | -2.68  | -1.71   | 9.93  |\n| Germany DAX | 18172          | -3.07  | -0.45   | 12.14 |\n| France CAC  | 7535           | -2.46  | -1.78   | 2.03  |\n| Italy 40    | 34216          | -1.05  | 1.61    | 18.74 |\n| UK FTSE     | 8156           | -1.18  | -1.41   | 6.67  |\n\n<br>\n\n| 10y Bond | Friday's Yield | Weekly | Monthly | YTD   |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| US       | 4.24           | 0.06   | -0.02   | 0.39  |\n| UK       | 4.12           | 0.02   | 0.07    | -0.15 |\n| Germany  | 2.46           | -0.03  | 0.04    | 0.01  |\n| Japan    | 1.04           | 0.00   | 0.09    | 0.59  |\n| China    | 2.27           | 0.01   | 0.03    | -0.39 |\n\n<br>\n\n### Asian Market :<br><br>\n\n**The Japanese stock market ended lower this week, primarily due to rising concerns over tighter US restrictions and disappointing economic data.** The Nikkei 225 Index fell by 2.7%. Technology stocks were particularly hard-hit by fears of stricter US restrictions on exporters of advanced semiconductor technology to China, including several Japanese chip makers. Japan's core inflation rate rose to 2.6% from 2.5%, slightly below the market forecast of 2.7%. Additionally, Japan's economic fragility was underscored by the government lowering its GDP growth forecast for the current fiscal year ending in March 2025 to 0.9%, down from the 1.3% projected in January.\n\n<br>\n\n**In contrast, the Chinese stock markets outperformed this week, buoyed by positive prospects from recent updates from the Third Plenary Session, despite some economic data concerns.** The Shanghai Composite Index rose by 0.37%, and the blue-chip CSI 300 added 1.92%. President Xi Jinping emphasized the need to tap into market potential by easing restrictions and implementing effective regulations to maintain order and address market challenges. Chinese officials are also focused on doubling the country’s economy by 2035 through support for the private sector, and stability-focused economic strategies. Moreover, China remained unaffected by the global IT outage.\n\n<br>\n\n**Economic Data :** \n\n- China's Third Plenum: Leaders pledge reforms, but dampen stimulus hopes\n\n- China retail sales growth slumps unexpectedly in June; industrial output growth beats estimates\n\n- China's Q2 GDP growth slows to 4.7% below estimates amid property downturn, weak domestic demand\n\n- China posts largest trade surplus in nearly two years, June exports surge; imports weaken\n\n- Japan's June producer inflation rose by 2.9% as expected, highest in ten months\n\n<br>\n\n| Index     | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY   |\n| --------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| NIKKEI    | 40064          | -2.74  | 3.70    | 23.31 |\n| SSE SH    | 2982           | 0.37   | -0.77   | -5.91 |\n| CSI 300   | 3539           | 1.92   | 1.02    | -7.45 |\n| Hang Seng | 17418          | -4.79  | -5.00   | -7.98 |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :<br><br>\n\n**The dollar index remained above 104.2 on Friday, gaining 0.4% in the previous session and rebounding sharply from a four-month low.** This rebound was driven by a risk-off sentiment following the global IT outage, which prompted investors to seek the safety of the dollar. European currencies depreciated this week due to concerns about economic impacts from trade tensions. The Japanese yen steadied around 157.3 per dollar, amid suspected government intervention. Investors are anticipating that the Bank of Japan might raise interest rates from their current near-zero levels when it meets on July 30-31. BOJ data suggests that authorities may have purchased nearly 6 trillion yen on July 11-12 through intervention, with a follow-up operation likely conducted on July 17.\n\n<br>\n\n**WTI crude futures fell by 3.2% to settle at $80 per barrel on Friday, driven by renewed hopes for a ceasefire in Gaza.** U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken indicated that a long-awaited truce between Israel and Hamas might be within reach. Additionally, a stronger dollar and concerns about China's economic outlook exerted downward pressure on oil prices, offsetting a tighter supply scenario.\n\n<br>\n\n**Gold prices ended the week lower, down 0.67%, retreating further from record highs as the dollar rebounded on Friday.** Market expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut remain strong, with a 98% chance of a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.\n\n<br>\n\n| Other markets | Friday's close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY    |\n| ------------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| DOLLAR        | 104.37         | 0.27   | 1.19    | 3.46   |\n| EUR/USD       | 1.08           | -0.23  | 1.63    | -2.22  |\n| GBP/USD       | 1.29           | -0.59  | 1.98    | 0.35   |\n| USD/JPY       | 157.50         | -0.23  | -0.91   | 12.44  |\n| USD/CNY       | 7.28           | 0.18   | -0.10   | 1.54   |\n| GOLD          | 2395           | -0.67  | 1.45    | 21.60  |\n| CRUDE OIL     | 80.02          | -2.67  | -1.57   | 6.08   |\n| BTC-USD       | 66692          | 15.30  | 2.76    | 124.18 |\n| ETH-USD       | 3505           | 12.14  | -0.20   | 85.74  |\n\n<br><br>\n\n---\n","tags":["Weekly Recap","Macro"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Regional Markets - Currencies Struggle Amid Stronger US Dollar and Domestic Economic Concerns","url":"/2024/07/20/mmarket_jul20/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **The Latin American markets were pressured this week by a stronger US dollar and domestic economic concerns, with the Brazilian real nearing a two-year low amid doubts over fiscal discipline and the Mexican peso weakening due to pessimistic IMF forecasts and economic slowdown.** \n\n- **India's rupee weakened near record lows amid broad currency weakness and RBI constraints, while Russia's ruble remained high despite reduced currency sales and US sanctions, and Turkey's lira fell due to a stronger dollar**\n\n<br>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n### Latin America : <br><br>\n\n### Brazil\n\n**The Brazilian real fell past 5.56 per USD driven by renewed concerns about fiscal discipline following recent comments by President Lula and a stronger US dollar.** Investors became more cautious due to doubts over Brazil's fiscal policy, sparked by Lula's remarks questioning the prioritization of fiscal framework compliance amidst other national priorities. This uncertainty raised concerns about the government’s commitment to fiscal prudence. The Ibovespa ended the week with a loss of 0.99%, with Magazine Luiza down 0.6%, Lojas Renner declining 0.5%, and Localiza falling 0.4%.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n### Mexico\n\n**The Mexican peso weakened to 18.04 per USD, influenced by pessimistic IMF forecasts and a stronger US dollar.** The IMF revised Mexico's 2024 GDP growth outlook from 2.4% to 2.2%, citing an economic slowdown, particularly in manufacturing due to reduced US economic activity. This slowdown pressured Banxico to adopt a more accommodative stance. The main Mexican stock market index (IPC) closed the week with a 2.32% loss.\n\n<br>\n\n### Argentina\n\nThe USD to ARS exchange rate increase by 0.58% for the week.

The usual defense measures against dollar buying could make Indian goods and services less competitive compared to Asian rivals in export markets. This challenge is highlighted by the RBI’s foreign currency reserves reaching a record high in July. The Sensex index is set to rise by 0.7% for the week, marking the seventh consecutive weekly gain, buoyed by expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and benefiting from the US-China trade tensions.\n\n<br>\n\n| Markets | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY   |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| USD/INR | 83.73          | 0.25   | 0.12    | 0.02  |\n| SENSEX  | 80605          | 0.11   | 4.03    | 19.29 |\n\n<br>\n\n### EU :<br><br>\n\n### Russia\n\n**The Russian ruble hovered around 87.70 per USD, pressured by reduced currency sales by exporters following their ruble tax payments.** Despite this, the ruble remains at historically high levels due to recent US sanctions on key financial systems, which have disrupted dollar and euro trading on the Moscow Exchange.

Additionally, reassuring remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell at a European banking conference on Tuesday seemed to bolster investor confidence. While he noted that inflation was unlikely to reach the Fed’s 2.0% target until late 2025 or 2026, he acknowledged significant progress in reducing it.\n\n<br>\n\n**Economic Data** \n\n- On Monday, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reported its lowest reading of manufacturing activity (48.5) since February, with levels below 50.0 indicating contraction.\n\n- ISM’s gauge of current services sector activity, reported Wednesday, plunged five points into contraction territory, from 53.8 in May to 48.8 in June.\n\n- On Tuesday, the Labor Department’s JOLTS report revealed that job openings slightly increased to 8.14 million in May, up from a downwardly revised 7.9 million in April, the lowest level in over three years.\n\n<br>\n\n| Index   | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY   |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| S&P 500 | 5567           | 1.95   | 4.00    | 26.19 |\n| DJIA    | 39376          | 0.66   | 1.26    | 16.08 |\n| Nasdaq  | 20392          | 3.60   | 7.21    | 35.14 |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### EU Market :<br><br>\n\n**EU stock markets ended higher, buoyed by the clarity of election results. The STOXX Europe 600 Index gained 1.01%.** Political uncertainty diminished as the far-right in France failed to secure an outright majority in the first round of legislative elections on June 30. Meanwhile, the Labour Party won the UK general election on July 4 with a significant majority. Major stock indexes rose, with France’s CAC 40 Index climbing 2.62%, Germany’s DAX gaining 1.32%, and Italy’s FTSE MIB increasing by 2.51%. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index added 0.49%.\n\n<br>\n\n**However, the EU bond market showed mixed performance this week due to varied economic data and a more hawkish stance from the European Central Bank (ECB).** At the ECB’s annual retreat in Portugal, President Christine Lagarde struck a slightly more hawkish tone, stating that Europe faces “several uncertainties regarding future inflation, particularly how the interaction of profits, wages, and productivity will evolve, and whether new supply-side shocks will impact the economy.” The final estimate of eurozone inflation confirmed that the year-over-year change in consumer prices decreased to 2.5% in June. In contrast, Germany’s manufacturing sector weakened further in May, with seasonally adjusted orders falling 1.6% sequentially and industrial production contracting by 2.5%. \n\n<br>\n\n**Economic Data**\n\n- France trade deficit grows to €8B in May\n\n- Germany's industrial production dips much lower than expected in May\n\n- UK services PMI drops to 52.1 in June\n\n- Euro Area composite and services PMI falls in June\n\n- France services PMI rises to 49.6 in June\n\n- Spain's services PMI eases slightly below 13-month peak\n\n- Euro Area inflation expected at 2.5% in June, unemployment rate unchanged\n\n- Germany's inflation expected at 2.2% in June\n\n- UK's manufacturing activity dips more than expected in June\n\n- Euro Area manufacturing falls in June as output drops\n\n- Germany's June manufacturing PMI falls to 43.50 points\n\n- Industrial output in France also declined, dropping by 2.1%\n\n<br>\n\n| Index       | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY   |\n| ----------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| STOXX 600   | 516            | 1.01   | -1.54   | 15.51 |\n| Germany DAX | 18475          | 1.32   | -0.95   | 18.98 |\n| France CAC  | 7676           | 2.62   | -4.53   | 8.38  |\n| Italy 40    | 33988          | 2.51   | -2.43   | 23.56 |\n| UK FTSE     | 8204           | 0.49   | -0.98   | 12.68 |\n\n<br>\n\n| 10y Bond | Friday's Yield | Weekly | Monthly | YTD   |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| US       | 4.27           | -0.11  | -0.01   | 0.24  |\n| UK       | 4.12           | -0.05  | -0.05   | -0.53 |\n| Germany  | 2.53           | 0.05   | -0.01   | -0.10 |\n| Japan    | 1.07           | 0.02   | 0.10    | 0.66  |\n| China    | 2.26           | 0.06   | -0.04   | -0.42 |\n\n<br>\n\n### Asian Market :<br><br>\n\n**Japanese stock markets outperformed due to continued weakening of the yen, with the Nikkei 225 Index climbing 3.36%.** A depreciating yen typically benefits export-focused industries. Japan’s 10-year sovereign bond yield rose to around 1.1%, its highest level since 2011, supported by expectations for actions from the Bank of Japan (BOJ). Speculation grew that a significantly weaker yen could prompt the BOJ to raise rates in July. The central bank highlighted that a weak yen increases import costs, contributing to inflationary pressures and impacting household consumption.\n\n<br>\n\n**Chinese stock markets declined as disappointing manufacturing data raised concerns about economic slowdown.** The Shanghai Composite Index recorded losses of 0.59%, while the blue-chip CSI 300 Index fell by 0.88%. China's manufacturing sector contracted for the second consecutive month in June, with the official manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) holding at 49.5, unchanged from May, amid declines in new orders and exports. The Caixin Services PMI was 51.2 in June, missing economists’ forecasts and slowing from 54 in May.\n\n<br>\n\n**Economic Data :** \n\n- Japan services PMI revised lower to 49.4 in June from preliminary data\n\n- China's service activity growth softens to slowest pace in eight months\n\n- China's manufacturing activity remains in contraction for second month at 49.5 in June\n\n- China’s factory growth in June reaches highest level in over three years to 51.8\n\n- Japan’s largest union group reported an average wage increase of 5.1%, the largest rise in 33 years\n\n<br>\n\n| Index     | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY    |\n| --------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| NIKKEI    | 40912          | 3.36   | 5.71    | 24.84  |\n| SSE SH    | 2950           | -0.59  | -3.24   | -7.97  |\n| CSI 300   | 3431           | -0.88  | -4.49   | -10.71 |\n| Hang Seng | 17800          | 0.46   | -3.67   | -3.96  |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :<br><br>\n\n**The dollar index fell below 105 on Friday, a level not seen since mid-June, following the latest jobs report which reinforced expectations that the Fed will begin its rate-cutting cycle in September.** Meanwhile, a more hawkish stance from the ECB contributed to the appreciation of the Euro against the Dollar. The Japanese yen also strengthened, crossing 161 per dollar, rebounding slightly from 38-year lows, primarily benefiting from a decline in the dollar.\n\n<br>\n\n**WTI crude futures climbed 2.33% this week to $83.44 per barrel, driven by robust summer fuel demand and potential supply disruptions from hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.** The US EIA reported a significant 12.2 million barrel drop in US crude stockpiles last week, far exceeding the anticipated 680K barrel draw. Additionally, Hurricane Beryl, a Category 2 storm, made landfall in Mexico, causing at least 11 fatalities and widespread damage across several Caribbean islands, further heightening supply concerns.\n\n<br>\n\n**Gold ended higher this week with 2.77% gains for the week for the weakening dollar.** The US jobs report reinforced expectations of upcoming rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which pressured the dollar and triggered broad gains in precious metals.\n\n<br>\n\n| Other markets | Friday's close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY   |\n| ------------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| DOLLAR        | 104.87         | -0.92  | 0.74    | 1.66  |\n| EUR/USD       | 1.08           | 1.18   | -0.49   | -0.45 |\n| GBP/USD       | 1.28           | 1.35   | -0.18   | -0.59 |\n| USD/JPY       | 160.75         | -0.06  | 3.26    | 11.59 |\n| USD/CNY       | 7.28           | -0.15  | 0.39    | 0.47  |\n| GOLD          | 2390           | 2.77   | 0.59    | 25.12 |\n| CRUDE OIL     | 83.44          | 2.33   | 10.44   | 16.23 |\n| BTC-USD       | 56247          | -6.73  | -20.54  | 85.57 |\n| ETH-USD       | 2969           | -11.99 | -22.12  | 57.74 |\n\n<br><br>\n\n---\n","tags":["Weekly Recap","Macro"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Regional Markets - Fed Boosts Latin America, India Stable, Russia's Ruble Weakens, Turkey Volatile","url":"/2024/07/06/mmarket_jul7/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **Latin American currencies benefited from expectations surrounding the Federal Reserve's upcoming monetary policy decisions.

Additionally, the ruble was supported by extensive capital controls implemented by the Kremlin, which artificially shielded the currency from pressure due to low foreign exchange inflows resulting from Western markets' avoidance of Russian energy exports.\n\n<br>\n\n### Turkey\n\n**The Turkish lira experienced slight depreciation this week, hovering around the 32.37 mark, largely due to the delay in the Federal Reserve's decision.** In May, the Turkish central bank maintained its interest rates at 50% and emphasized that monetary policy would be tightened if significant and persistent inflation deterioration is anticipated. The annual inflation rate climbed to 75.45% in May, leading the central bank to revise its year-end inflation forecast upward from 36% to 38%. Despite these challenges, the central bank remains optimistic that the tight monetary policy will gradually ease demand pressures by the second half of the year.\n\n<br>\n\n| Markets  | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY   |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| USD/RUB  | 89.34          | -0.84  | -2.83   | 8.96  |\n| USD/TRY  | 32.37          | 0.40   | 0.21    | 40.02 |\n| MOEX     | 3230           | 0.56   | -5.94   | 19.22 |\n| BIST 100 | 10139          | -2.51  | -1.06   | 82.55 |\n| TURKEY-B | 26.22          | 0.27   | -0.32   | 11.41 |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :\n\n| Markets | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY    |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| USD/CHF | 0.89           | -0.64  | -1.26   | -0.21  |\n| USD/KRW | 1353           | -1.30  | -1.85   | 1.41   |\n| USD/NGN | 1471           | -1.06  | 4.53    | 218.67 |\n| USD/ZAR | 18.88          | 0.49   | 1.68    | 0.29   |\n| TAIEX   | 21858          | 3.23   | 5.59    | 30.63  |\n| NSE     | 99222          | -0.08  | -1.02   | 77.32  |\n\n---\n","tags":["Weekly Recap","Regional Markets"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Markets Recap - US Hits Record Highs, Europe Wavers on ECB Caution, Asian Sentiment Mixed","url":"/2024/05/18/macro_may18/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **US markets rallied to record highs as inflation concerns eased with the latest CPI data, while European markets initially surged but later retreated on cautious comments from ECB members regarding monetary policy easing, particularly in light of strong UK pay growth potentially fueling inflationary pressures.** \n\n- **Asian markets saw Japanese stocks rise on the back of a stronger yen, while Chinese markets remained cautious despite government intervention to stabilize the property sector.**\n\n- **In other markets, the dollar depreciated amid expectations of rate cuts, while WTI crude futures strengthened on declining inventories and optimism about potential Fed rate cuts, and gold prices surged to a record high fueled by expectations of Fed easing and geopolitical tensions.**  \n\n<br>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n### US Market : <br><br>\n\n**US stock markets climbed to record highs this week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossing the 40,000 threshold for the first time.** Despite ongoing concerns about interest rates, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank's commitment to achieving its inflation target.

Additionally, increased foreign exchange inflows from key countries' oil and gas shipments, coupled with declining imports, contributed to the ruble's resilience.

Market expectations suggest the possibility of two additional rate hikes within the next year.\n\n<br>\n\n**In China, stock markets retreated as weak inflation data pointed to lackluster demand in the country's economy.** The Shanghai Composite Index declined 0.91%, while the blue chip CSI 300 dropped 1.69%. China's consumer price index rose a below-consensus 0.1% in March year-over-year, a decrease from February's 0.7% rise, as food costs normalized after the Lunar New Year holiday. Additionally, disappointing export data added concerns about economic recovery, with exports falling 7.5% in March, reversing gains from the first two months of the year.\n\n<br>\n\n**Economic Data :** \n\n- China's trade surplus smaller than expected as exports drop more than imports\n\n- Japan's industrial output falls more than initially anticipated to 0.6% in February\n\n- China's inflation rate rises at a slower pace than expected\n\n- Fitch cuts China's credit outlook to negative on public finance risks\n\n- Japan's producer prices up 0.8% in March, rise the most in five months\n\n- Japan's consumer confidence index rises to 39.5 in March\n\n<br>\n\n| Index     | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY    |\n| --------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| NIKKEI    | 39524          | 1.36   | 2.14    | 40.37  |\n| SSE SH    | 3019           | -0.91  | -0.80   | -9.01  |\n| CSI 300   | 3477           | -1.69  | -2.17   | -11.05 |\n| Hang Seng | 16722          | -0.01  | -2.11   | -17.81 |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :<br><br>\n\n**The dollar index extended gains for a third consecutive session to approach 106 on Friday, the highest level since early November, bolstered by geopolitical tensions and expectations that the Federal Reserve will maintain rates higher for longer.** Traders reduced their bets on Fed rate cuts this year following the CPI report, which revealed persistent inflationary pressures in the U.S. The euro/dollar pair experienced losses, while the USD/JPY reached a record high of 153.\n\n<br>\n\n**WTI crude futures rose towards $86 per barrel on Friday, closing in on the highest level since October 20th, as the potential for a wider conflict in the Middle East fueled concerns about further supply disruptions.** Israel is reportedly preparing for a direct attack from Iran within the next 24 to 48 hours after Tehran vowed retaliation against a suspected Israeli attack on its embassy in Syria. Meanwhile, ongoing ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas have failed to deliver results, leading Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to continue the conflict in Gaza. On the demand side, strong U.S. inflation data diminished hopes for early interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, potentially dampening energy demand prospects.\n\n<br>\n\n**Gold climbed past $2,410 per ounce on Friday, marking a new record high and advancing around 0.58% over the week, as robust safe-haven demand overshadowed concerns regarding a possible delay in Fed rate cuts.** Traders increased their bullion purchases amid reports suggesting Iran was preparing for an imminent attack on Israel.\n\n<br>\n\n| Other markets | Friday's close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY    |\n| ------------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| DOLLAR        | 106.01         | 1.64   | 3.14    | 4.95   |\n| EUR/USD       | 1.06           | -1.80  | -2.79   | -3.66  |\n| GBP/USD       | 1.24           | -1.48  | -2.71   | -0.57  |\n| USD/JPY       | 153.19         | 1.05   | 3.69    | 15.57  |\n| USD/CNY       | 7.26           | 0.28   | 1.02    | 5.75   |\n| GOLD          | 2343           | 0.58   | 7.76    | 14.87  |\n| CRUDE OIL     | 85.39          | -1.74  | 7.69    | 4.09   |\n| BTC-USD       | 67014          | -0.92  | -8.40   | 121.19 |\n| ETH-USD       | 3228           | -2.91  | -19.14  | 60.73  |\n\n<br><br>\n\n---\n","tags":["Weekly Recap","Macro"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Regional Markets - Emerging Market Currencies Hit by Geopolitical Tensions and US Inflation Pressures","url":"/2024/04/13/mmarket_apr13/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **Latin American markets faced pressure this week as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and shifting monetary policy expectations globally weighed on the Brazilian real and Mexican peso, with both currencies weakening due to safe-haven demand for the US dollar.** \n\n- **US inflation data significantly impacted other markets, leading to depreciation in the Indian rupee and Russian ruble due to expectations of monetary easing and weaker currency interventions, while the Turkish lira hit fresh record lows amid political and economic uncertainties following local elections.**\n\n<br>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n### Latin America : <br><br>\n\n### Brazil\n\n**The Brazilian real weakened past the 5.13 per USD mark in April, reaching its lowest level since early October as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East prompted a shift away from riskier emerging market currencies and respective expectation for its monetary policy.** Dovish expectations for the Brazilian central bank added to the pressure on the real, while recent inflation data showed a slower-than-expected pace in Brazilian consumer prices at 3.93%, the lowest in nine months. This development fell within the upper tolerance limit set by the BCB and reinforced expectations for continued rate cuts post-June. Meanwhile, strong retail sales figures pointed to resilience in the Brazilian consumer, fostering hopes for economic traction. The Ibovespa fell by 1.18% to close at 127,400 on Friday, reflecting global risk aversion amid escalating tensions in the Middle East and uncertainty regarding future Fed interest rates.

The pressure on the rupee was exacerbated by expectations that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may avoid aggressively defending the rupee as it has done since the third quarter of 2023. Furthermore, speculation that the People's Bank of China (PBoC) may accept weaker dollar pegs contributed to bets that Indian policymakers might respond with weaker intervention, allowing the rupee to depreciate alongside the yuan.

This raised fears of a shift from recent orthodox economic policies to a more permissive fiscal stance. However, President Erdogan accepted the defeat and expressed confidence that his efforts to control inflation would yield results this year.\n\n<br>\n\n| Markets  | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY   |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| USD/RUB  | 93.43          | 1.00   | 2.28    | 14.36 |\n| USD/TRY  | 32.36          | 1.01   | 1.42    | 67.56 |\n| MOEX     | 3457           | 1.82   | 4.11    | 35.88 |\n| BIST 100 | 9814           | 9.71   | 7.47    | 91.52 |\n| TURKEY-B | 25.62          | 0.93   | -0.26   | 13.90 |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :\n\n| Markets | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY    |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| USD/CHF | 0.91           | 1.42   | 4.04    | 2.80   |\n| USD/KRW | 1379           | 2.13   | 5.02    | 6.04   |\n| USD/NGN | 1202           | -3.42  | -24.54  | 161.34 |\n| USD/ZAR | 18.86          | 1.08   | 1.59    | 4.58   |\n| TAIEX   | 20737          | 1.56   | 4.05    | 31.20  |\n| NSE     | 102315         | -1.09  | -1.63   | 96.97  |\n\n---\n","tags":["Weekly Recap","Regional Markets"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Markets Recap - Stocks Stall on Rate Cut Concerns, Asian Markets Diverge","url":"/2024/04/07/macro_apr6/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **Stock markets in both the US and EU retreated this week amid concerns over potential delays in interest rate cuts, fueled by hawkish comments from US Federal Reserve policymakers and a surge in crude oil prices.** \n\n- **Mixed performance in Asian markets this week, with Japanese stocks declining amid global uncertainties while Chinese equities outperformed on positive economic indicators and policy support.** \n\n- **Other markets saw the dollar strengthening on positive economic data, gold hitting a record high amid US rate cut expectations, and crude oil remaining steady amidst escalating geopolitical tensions.** \n\n<br>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n### US Market : <br><br>\n\n**Stocks retreated from record highs as signs of a potential manufacturing sector revival raised concerns about inflationary pressures.** The pullback was notable across large-cap indexes, with U.S. Treasury yields rising in response to the burgeoning optimism in the manufacturing sector.

Powell's remarks suggested a less hawkish stance, indicating that policymakers were nearing confidence in the sustained downtrend of inflation, potentially paving the way for rate cuts.\n\n<br>\n\n**Economic Data** \n\n- Friday's jobs report initially reassured investors about the labor market, with employers adding more jobs than forecasted in February. \n\n- However, January's gains were revised lower, and the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to its highest level in over two years, reaching 3.9%.\n\n<br>\n\n| Index   | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY   |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| S&P 500 | 5123           | --0.26 | 1.93    | 30.76 |\n| DJIA    | 38723          | -0.93  | 0.13    | 20.05 |\n| Nasdaq  | 18018          | -1.55  | 0.31    | 50.21 |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### EU Market :<br><br>\n\n**In the EU stock markets, most indices ended the week on a positive note, except for the UK.** Investor sentiment was buoyed by the European Central Bank's (ECB) revised inflation forecasts, with notable gains seen in Italy’s FTSE MIB, France’s CAC 40 Index, and Germany’s DAX. Additionally, companies like Novo Nordisk stood out, displacing Tesla as the 12th biggest public company by market capitalization due to strong demand for its diabetes and weight loss drugs. However, the UK market faced some noise, particularly surrounding Jeremy Hunt's announcement in his last Spring Budget before a general election. The reduction in national insurance rates and adjustments to tax statuses were notable factors affecting investor perceptions.\n\n<br>\n\n**In the bond markets, ten-year government bond yields for Germany, Italy, and France declined following the ECB's decision to leave its monetary policy unchanged.** The central bank signaled the possibility of interest rate cuts in June and revised its inflation and economic growth forecasts lower. ECB President Christine Lagarde acknowledged progress toward the 2.0% inflation target but emphasized the need for sustained confidence in falling inflation. The central bank now anticipates inflation reaching 2.0% by 2025, a revision from the previous forecast of 2026.\n\n<br>\n\n**Economic Data**\n\n- ECB keeps rates unchanged for fourth meeting; revises down inflation projections, and ECB policymakers said to back first rate cut in June \n\n- Euro Area producer price inflation stays flat in January\n\n- UK services PMI marginally lower in February, composite PMI increases\n\n- Germany's services PMI at 48.3 in February, a two-month high, France services PMI rises to 48.4 in February, beating consensus, while France industrial production drops 1.1% in January\n\n- Euro Area services and composite PMI rises in February\n\n<br>\n\n| Index       | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY   |\n| ----------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| STOXX 600   | 503            | 1.14   | 3.80    | 9.41  |\n| Germany DAX | 17815          | 0.45   | 5.25    | 13.95 |\n| France CAC  | 8028           | 1.18   | 4.98    | 9.73  |\n| Italy 40    | 33272          | 1.03   | 4.98    | 9.73  |\n| UK FTSE     | 7660           | -0.30  | 1.15    | -2.79 |\n\n<br>\n\n| 10y Bond | Friday's Yield | Weekly | Monthly | YTD   |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| US       | 4.07           | -0.11  | -0.11   | 0.15  |\n| UK       | 3.97           | -0.14  | -0.11   | 0.20  |\n| Germany  | 2.26           | -0.14  | -0.11   | -0.37 |\n| Japan    | 0.73           | 0.02   | 0.01    | 0.23  |\n| China    | 2.30           | -0.08  | -016    | -0.59 |\n\n<br>\n\n### Asian Market :<br><br>\n\n**Japan's Nikkei surpassed the 40,000 mark for the first time, continuing its historic rally driven by significant yen weakness over the past three years.** However, the index saw a slight dip from Thursday's levels, attributed partly to decreased enthusiasm from tech companies. In the bond markets, investor speculation persisted regarding the Bank of Japan’s potential monetary policy trajectory, with growing conviction that the central bank may be nearing a decision to raise short-term interest rates from negative territory. Comments by a BoJ board member indicated optimism about a virtuous cycle of prices rising alongside wages.\n\n<br>\n\n**Chinese equities saw gains as recent government measures to stabilize the market boosted investor confidence despite uncertainties in the economic outlook**. The Shanghai Composite Index and the blue chip CSI 300 both posted modest increases. During the National People's Congress (NPC), China's parliament, Beijing set an economic growth target of around 5% for the year, consistent with the previous year's target. In the bond market, the government announced plans to maintain a budget deficit target of around 3% and issued special ultra-long central government bonds worth RMB 1 trillion to support growth.\n\n<br>\n\n**Economic Data :** \n\n- China's trade surplus larger than expected in February amid surge in exports, with above-consensus 7.1% in January and February from the prior-year period, improving from December’s 2.3% increase\n\n- China sets bold growth targets, calls for 'support from all fronts'\n\n- China's services sector posts growth at 3-month low to 52.5 in February\n\n- Japan Services PMI revised higher to 52.9 in February amid rise in domestic demand\n\n<br>\n\n| Index     | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY    |\n| --------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| NIKKEI    | 39689          | -0.56  | 7.57    | 38.66  |\n| SSE SH    | 3046           | 0.63   | 4.65    | -7.02  |\n| CSI 300   | 3545           | 0.20   | 4.15    | -11.81 |\n| Hang Seng | 16353          | -0.52  | 5.64    | 10.75  |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :<br><br>\n\n**In the currency markets, investors responded to signals from central banks,** including the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of Japan (BOJ), resulting in appreciation for the yen, euro, and GBP against the dollar. Throughout the week, the euro gained 0.92% and the GBP strengthened by 1.63%, contributing to a 1.08% decline in the dollar.\n\n<br>\n\n**Market sentiment remained cautious amid concerns about Chinese demand, despite the OPEC+ group's decision to extend supply cuts.** WTI crude futures experienced a 2.45% loss for the week, settling 1.17% lower at $78.01 per barrel on Friday. Tight supplies, driven by OPEC's production cuts and sanctions impacting Russian exports, were overshadowed by worries about reduced demand from China. Chinese oil imports fell by approximately 5.7% in the first two months of the year compared to December figures.\n\n<br>\n\n**Amid economic uncertainty, safe-haven assets, including gold, continued to climb, posting a 4.57% gain for the week.** Gold surged to a new record high, approaching $2,200 an ounce on Friday, buoyed by the latest jobs report reinforcing expectations of imminent interest rate cuts, potentially as early as March.\n\n<br>\n\n| Other markets | Friday's close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY    |\n| ------------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| DOLLAR        | 102.73         | -1.08  | -1.32   | -2.44  |\n| EUR/USD       | 1.09           | 0.92   | 1.44    | 3.37   |\n| GBP/USD       | 1.28           | 1.63   | 1.88    | 7.81   |\n| USD/JPY       | 147.03         | -2.05  | -1.52   | 8.00   |\n| USD/CNY       | 7.19           | -0.13  | -0.25   | 3.20   |\n| GOLD          | 2178           | 4.57   | 7.63    | 18.99  |\n| CRUDE OIL     | 78.01          | -2.45  | 1.62    | 2.81   |\n| BTC-USD       | 68443          | 10.44  | 42.73   | 240.60 |\n| ETH-USD       | 3916           | 14.80  | 55.95   | 174.65 |\n\n<br><br>\n\n---\n","tags":["Weekly Recap","Macro"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Regional Markets - Emerging Markets React to Economic Strength and US Rate Cut Speculation","url":"/2024/03/09/mmarket_mar9/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **In the emerging markets, most currencies appreciated due to the robust economy and potential US rate cuts. the Brazilian real depreciated for the concerns on its interest rate hikes while the Mexican peso strengthened amid speculation about potential US interest rate cuts and subdued Mexican inflation figures.** \n\n- **The Indian rupee held firm, supported by expectations of US monetary policy easing and India's robust economic performance, including a GDP growth rate exceeding market expectations.

In the stock markets, the Ibovespa declined by 1.02%, closing at 127,036 on Friday, primarily due to significant losses from the state-owned oil giant Petrobras. Petrobras' decision not to declare extraordinary dividends prompted downgrades from several major financial institutions, including Santander, Bradesco BBI, Citi, Safra, and Goldman Sachs. These downgrades cited increased uncertainties regarding capital allocation risk, leading to a 10.25% decline in Petrobras shares.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n### Mexico\n\n**The Mexican peso strengthened toward the 16.8 per USD mark in early March, reaching an over six-month high, driven by a weakening US dollar and positive economic data.** The release of economic data heightened speculation about a potential interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve in June, which weakened support for the greenback. Investors are eagerly awaiting the Bank of Mexico's decision on March 21 following subdued Mexican inflation figures. In February, the year-on-year inflation rate was 4.40%, slightly below the estimated 4.42% and January's 4.88%. The monthly Consumer Price Index decreased marginally from 0.11% in January to 0.09%. Although the Core CPI, excluding volatile items, exceeded expectations by rising to 4.64%, it was lower than the previous 4.76%. Additionally, the monthly core CPI aligned with estimates, increasing from 0.40% to 0.49% in February.\n\n<br>\n\n### Argentina\n\nThe USD to ARS exchange rate slumped by 0.42% for the week. Notably, Argentina's main stock market index, Merval, gave up 4.99% this week as investors are concerned about the domestic economy. \n\n<br>\n\n| Markets    | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY    |\n| ---------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| USD/BRL    | 4.98           | 0.53   | 0.58    | -3.56  |\n| USD/MXN    | 16.80          | -1.19  | -1.57   | -8.37  |\n| USD/ARS    | 846            | 0.42   | 1.84    | 322.51 |\n| IBOVESPA   | 127071         | -1.63  | -0.75   | 20.94  |\n| IPC MEXICO | 54911          | -1.13  | -4.22   | 2.78   |\n| MERVAL     | 1002336        | -4.99  | -11.18  | 304.90 |\n| BRAZIL-B   | 10.80          | 0.06   | 0.12    | -2.39  |\n| MEXICO-B   | 9.15           | 0.00   | -0.01   | 0.03   |\n\n<br>\n\n### Asia :<br><br>\n\n### India\n\n**The Indian rupee still remained strong, hovering 83 per USD, retracting from its four-month high of 82.2 on January 15th, as expectations of US monetory policy easing and robust economy for India.** The country’s GDP expanded by 8.4% from the previous year in the December quarter, well above market expectations of 6.6%, to lift the second estimate of the current fiscal GDP to a 7.6% growth rate.\n\n<br>\n\n| Markets | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY   |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| USD/INR | 82.73          | -0.12  | -0.31   | 0.88  |\n| SENSEX  | 74119          | 2.23   | 3.77    | 22.82 |\n\n<br>\n\n### EU :<br><br>\n\n### Russia\n\n**Russian currency and index benefit from the pocily stance from EU,US and rising oil price.** The Russian ruble appreciated to around 90.5 per USD, marking its highest level in a month. This surge was fueled by expectations of increased foreign currency inflow from exporters' tax payments, following reports of strong oil and gas revenues. According to the country's finance ministry report, oil and gas revenues crucial for the economy are anticipated to rise to 132.1 billion rubles in March 2024. Additionally, a weaker global dollar index and larger sales of foreign currency during the dividend season are expected to provide further support. Markets are now eagerly awaiting a decision on the possible extension of capital controls for the largest firms from April until the end of the year, while also closely monitoring the inflation outlook for cues about the start of monetary easing.\n\n<br>\n\n### Turkey\n\n**Turkey's lira underperformed among emerging markets due to concerns about inflation and the economy.** The Turkish lira extended its losses, reaching fresh record lows past 31 per USD, as traders continued to assess Turkey's monetary and economic outlook. Annual inflation accelerated for a fourth consecutive month to 67% in February, the highest level since November 2022. The finance minister anticipates that inflation will remain elevated due to base effects and the delayed impact of rate hikes, but projects a decline within the next year. Concerns persist about a stronger depreciation of the lira after the local elections on March 31st, similar to the significant fall seen in May last year following the presidential and general elections.\n\n<br>\n\n| Markets  | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY   |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| USD/RUB  | 90.94          | -0.82  | -0.06   | 19.91 |\n| USD/TRY  | 31.93          | 1.99   | 4.50    | 68.54 |\n| MOEX     | 3216           | 1.81   | 2.28    | 44.78 |\n| BIST 100 | 9155           | 0.64   | 1.21    | 68.10 |\n| TURKEY-B | 26.34          | 0.68   | 1.95    | 14.83 |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :\n\n| Markets | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY    |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| USD/CHF | 0.87           | -0.66  | 0.34    | -5.91  |\n| USD/KRW | 1316           | -1.09  | -1.06   | -0.72  |\n| USD/NGN | 1593           | 3.13   | 8.12    | 246.36 |\n| USD/ZAR | 18.72          | -2.03  | -1.55   | 0.88   |\n| TAIEX   | 19785          | 4.49   | 6.12    | 25.46  |\n| NSE     | 101331         | 2.61   | -0.52   | 81.52  |\n\n---\n","tags":["Weekly Recap","Regional Markets"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Stocks Recap - EV Carmakers Mixed, Tech Suppliers Surge","url":"/2024/03/06/sector_mar6/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **EV carmakers had mixed performance.

This week, ASML achieved a significant milestone by reaching the 'first light' landmark on its new EUV lithography system. \n\n<br>\n\nAdditionally, India's approval of a $15.2 billion investment in chip manufacturing and Mobileye's positive conference commentary led to a surge in shares, gaining over 10% intraday. Despite a recent share value decline, Mobileye's EyeQ technology, capable of complex vision tasks, has been adopted by more than 50 vehicle manufacturers.

Published posthumously in 1964.** This memoir captures Hemingway's experiences and interactions with other literary luminaries of the time. Through its pages, readers are transported to the bohemian streets of Paris, where Hemingway navigates the challenges of artistic pursuit while rubbing shoulders with figures such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein.\n\n<br>\n\n## Personal Takeaway\n\n<br>\n\nIn 'A Moveable Feast,' Hemingway's depiction of his modest yet joyous existence in Paris struck a chord with me. While I couldn't fully engage with the café culture or grasp the nuances of the artistic milieu he encountered, his evocative portrayal of Parisian scenes, such as the blossoming horse chestnut trees in the Luxembourg Garden, transported me to familiar settings near my home. I found resonance in his descriptions of serene moments by the river and the enchanting pathways leading to Versailles, illustrating the timeless allure of Paris. Despite his financial constraints, Hemingway's encounters with kindness in Paris echoed the warmth I experienced through my grandmother's gestures in a foreign land. Moreover, I empathized with his acknowledgment of the city's bleak seasons, reminiscent of my own less favorable times in Paris. Yet, even amidst its darkest days, Paris exuded a peculiar charm, reminiscent of snowy winters and mist-shrouded sunrises. \n\n<br>\n\nThrough Hemingway's narrative lens, I came to understand Paris not merely as a geographical entity but as a tapestry of diverse memories, each individual's encounter unique yet interwoven. Though my memories of Paris remain etched in my heart, I am forever indebted to the richness it brought into my life. ***If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast. Yes, I am so lucky.***\n\n<br>\n\n***But Paris was a very old city and we were young and nothing was simple there, not even poverty, nor sudden money, nor the moonlight, nor right and wrong nor the breathing of someone who lay beside you in the moonlight.***\n\n---\n\n### \n","tags":["BookReview"],"categories":["Beyond"]},{"title":"Why Paris Is A Moverable Feast","url":"/2024/03/03/culture_mar1/","content":"\n<br>\n\n#### <br>***If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.***\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n## The Allure of Cities\n\n<br>\n\nWhen it comes to why people love a particular city, there's often a blend of subjective and objective factors at play. It's a deeply personal connection, shaped by individual preferences, experiences, and desires. Each city offers a unique tapestry of attractions and characteristics, catering to a diverse range of tastes and interests. **<u>When what the city offer and individual preference match, affinity occurs. </u>**\n\n<br>\n\nFor some, the appeal lies in the vibrant energy of a bustling metropolis that never sleeps, making New York City their top choice. Others may be drawn to the tranquil beauty of natural scenery, leading them to favor destinations like Switzerland. Perhaps you're enchanted by the timeless sophistication of old school charm, making London your preferred destination. Alternatively, the gritty, avant-garde atmosphere of Berlin might resonate with those who appreciate a sense of edgy authenticity. For those seeking festive excitement, the colorful carnival atmosphere of Brazil could be irresistible. If you're captivated by wildlife and adventure, the untamed landscapes of Africa may call to you. And for those who appreciate sheer beauty and romance, Paris inevitably becomes the destination of choice.\n\n<br>\n\n## The Perfect Harmony : A Sensory Exploration\n\n<br>\n\n**<u>Objectively speaking, Paris is a city that adores beauty, and it excels at providing aesthetic experiences like no other. In terms of aesthetics, Paris achieves the pinnacle, from sensual aspects. </u>** \n\n<br>\n\nWhat skin brings in paris sensually, during the spring and autumn seasons, Paris offers a climate that feels just right - the perfect balance of temperature, humidity, and sunshine characteristic of its temperate maritime climate. It's a comfortable sensation, devoid of the scorching heat of Southern European summers, the biting cold of Northern European winters, or the relentless rain of London or humid summers in Taiwan.\n\n<br>\n\nWhat the eyes behold in Paris is a symphony of harmonious and cohesive Haussmannian architecture, the dappled shadows cast by plane trees lining the road to the Palace of Versailles, an abundance of artistic masterpieces waiting to be discovered in museums, and the sight of people leisurely strolling along the Seine, basking in the sunlight. Among them, you might spot impeccably dressed fashionistas clutching bouquets of flowers, adding to the city's allure.\n\n<br>\n\nWhat the ears are treated to in Paris are melodies drifting along the banks of the Seine, the electronic beats of parades in November, the exhilarating performances of firefighters on Bastille Day, and the spirited chants of protestors advocating for freedom and individuality.\n\n<br>\n\nAnd what conversations in Paris entail are greetings of 'Bonjour,' 'Bonne journée' for a lovely day, and 'joue contre joue' the tender gesture of a kiss on the cheek upon meeting. In Paris, every aspect of the experience is carefully curated to evoke a sense of romance and enchantment, making it a city where love and beauty intertwine effortlessly.\n\n<br>\n\n## Where Everything Feels Just Right\n\n<br>\n\n**<u>In essence, much like how people have a preferred temperature range for comfort, Paris provides an environment that feels just right, very suitable, and wonderfully relaxed. Paris benefits from a combination of exceptional natural conditions and intentional asthetic efforts. </u>**\n\n<br>\n\nThe city enjoys a favorable natural conditions that strike the ideal balance. Unlike some other regions, Paris is not plagued by extremes - it's neither oppressively cold nor swelteringly hot. Its river, the Seine, is near perfect in size and speed, unlike the Danube in Hungary, which can feel a bit too rushing, or the smaller rivers in Amsterdam, which might seem miserly by comparison. \n\n<br>\n\nThis climate also lends itself to a slight intoxication from the red wine that flows freely, inducing a gentle, tipsy state rather than the inebriation of strong spirits or the sobriety of light beers. When one is slightly intoxicated, they often become endearing and romantic, expressing affectionate words to friends and lovers that they may not say when sober. It's this romantic ambiance that makes Paris forever enchanting.\n\n<br>\n\nThe presence of French plane trees, often found near the Palace of Versailles, further enhances Paris's charm. These trees line the roadsides with just the right amount of shade and color, not overly dark green like the foliage in Taiwan during summer, nor the desolate barren trees seen in northern China during winter. Instead, they provide a perfect canopy, allowing just enough sunlight to filter through.\n\n<br>\n\nOn the other side, the city owes much of its charm to the high-quality aesthetics cultivated by Parisians. This includes the meticulous urban planning, the ever-evolving fashion scene, and the countless contributions from artists. \n\n<br>\n\nAs for city planning for instance, Paris's city planning is celebrated for its wide boulevards, uniform Haussmannian architecture, iconic landmarks, and abundant green spaces, collectively contributing to its unparalleled appeal. The expansive boulevards not only facilitate traffic flow but also provide a sense of openness and grandeur, inviting leisurely strolls and vibrant street life. The uniformity of Haussmannian architecture lends a timeless elegance to the cityscape, with limestone buildings and wrought-iron balconies adorning every corner. Coupled with iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and Notre-Dame Cathedral, Paris exudes an undeniable charm that captivates the imagination. Amidst this urban splendor, Paris boasts an array of green spaces, from the sprawling Tuileries Garden to the charming squares tucked away in residential neighborhoods, offering tranquil retreats amidst the bustling cityscape.\n\n<br>\n\nLet alone refined fashion taste of Parisians, Paris, renowned as the fashion capital of the world, sets the bar high when it comes to style and elegance. Parisians effortlessly exude a sense of chic sophistication, with their impeccable fashion sense and ability to effortlessly combine timeless classics with avant-garde trends. From iconic fashion houses to trendy boutiques, Paris offers a shopping experience like no other. High-end luxury brands line the streets of the Champs Elysées, while charming cobblestone alleyways hide hidden gems waiting to be discovered. Let alone the exquisite holiday decorations adorning the shops along the Champs Elysées, the interior decor of Galeries Lafayette, and the jewelry boutiques near the Liberation Monument. They strike the perfect balance of luxury without the overpowering scent of food on the ground floor, exuding only the elegance befitting the fashion capital of the world.\n\n<br>\n\nIn conclusion, the essence of Paris is encapsulated in moments of just right, like the feeling of basking in the warm sun in a tranquil park and leisurely strolling along the Seine River, taking in the picturesque street scenes on either bank. As the gentle breeze rustles through, sitting by the Seine, sipping wine, and listening to music as night descends, one witnesses couples lost in tender embraces amidst the shimmering lights scattered across the river. This isn't merely a movable feast—it is called \"***<u>Paris</u>***\".\n\n<br>\n\n## Paris in Literature and Film\n\n<br>\n\nIn literature and film, Paris has served as a captivating backdrop that evokes a sense of nostalgia, romance, and escapism. Ernest Hemingway's \"A Moveable Feast\" provides a glimpse into the author's experiences during his time in Interwar France, where he found camaraderie among the cultural luminaries of the Lost Generation. For Hemingway, this period represented the pinnacle of literary inspiration, where good times were shared with like-minded individuals in the most enchanting of places.\n\n<br>\n\nWoody Allen's \"Midnight in Paris\" beautifully captures the allure of Paris in the 1920s, painting scenes with a delicate brushstroke of golden light and shadow, imbuing the era with an air of luxury and tranquility. Through the protagonist's encounters with Hemingway and his longing for the past, the film explores the human desire to escape reality and seek refuge in nostalgia. However, as the protagonist discovers, the past may not always live up to one's idealized perceptions, and the present holds its own beauty and significance, present is something you can control. ***That's what the present is. It's a little unsatisfying because life's a little unsatisfying.*** At the end of the movie, the right person stood in the rain, on his favorite street, and told him, ***\"It doesn't matter, I don't mind getting wet.\"***  ,while his fiancee didn't understand, ***\"Paris is the most beautiful when it rains\"*** \n\n<br>\n\nDespite the romanticized portrayal of Paris in literature and film, the city's allure transcends mere fantasy. As an engineering student, I refrain from delving into personal subjective experiences, but the time spent in Paris remains etched in my heart. Paris, with its complexity and richness, is a city where nothing is simple, yet every experience holds a profound significance. \n\n<br>\n\n***But Paris was a very old city and we were young and nothing was simple there, not even poverty, nor sudden money, nor the moonlight, nor right and wrong nor the breathing of someone who lay beside you in the moonlight.***\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n### \n","tags":["Culture","Country"],"categories":["Beyond"]},{"title":"Markets Recap - Divergent Paths Amid Inflationary Pressures and Monetary Policy Speculations","url":"/2024/03/02/macro_mar2/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **The US and EU markets exhibited divergent reactions this week, largely influenced by contrasting performances in inflation.

Latest inflation data exceeded the BCB’s upper tolerance band at 4.51%, indicating upside risks. Additionally, Brazil’s trade surplus in January missed market expectations, exacerbating an unexpected decline in foreign direct investment from December and limiting foreign currency inflows. In the stock market, the Ibovespa secured a modest gain of 0.5% for the week, supported by mixed corporate results. Despite a 35% decline in fourth-quarter profits, Vale announced dividends exceeding R$11 billion, with its shares ending slightly higher by 0.3%, helping offset the impact of disappointing earnings reports on the index. However, state-owned oil giant Petrobras led the energy sector downward with a 0.5% loss, influenced by lower oil prices.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n### Mexico\n\n**Mexico, the peso depreciated amid anticipation of a central bank rate cut.** The Mexican peso weakened to around 17.11 per USD by Friday, reaching a one-week low amid growing expectations of an imminent rate cut by the Mexican central bank.

Headline inflation declined to a year-over-year rate of 4.5%, down from 4.9% in the previous reading, while core inflation fell to 4.6%, compared to 4.8% previously.

India's composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) exceeded 60 for the second consecutive month in February, reinforcing the robust 7.3% growth achieved in FY2023. This stellar performance outpaced other major economies, fostering a bullish environment and attracting foreign exchange inflows. Foreign investment into India also benefited from investors reallocating funds away from China, propelling the Sensex towards record highs and driving down the yield on the 10-year Government Securities (G-Sec) to multi-month lows. Robust economic growth provided further support to the rupee, offering the RBI flexibility to maintain its hawkish stance.\n\n<br>\n\n| Markets | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY   |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| USD/INR | 82.85          | -0.19  | -0.33   | -0.05 |\n| SENSEX  | 73143          | 0.99   | 2.93    | 23.00 |\n\n<br>\n\n### EU :<br><br>\n\n### Russia\n\n**The ruble steadied near 93 per USD amid EU sanctions concerns.** The Russian ruble steadied near 93 per USD, hovering close to a two-month low reached on February 19th. This was primarily influenced by news of the 13th package of EU sanctions, anticipated for approval by the end of the week. Stricter sanctions could potentially halt loading activities and exacerbate the fuel production and export constraints due to Ukrainian attacks on Russian refineries, intensifying the existing capacity crisis. Additionally, the Central Bank of Russia revised its medium-term forecast for the current account from $75 billion to $42 billion in 2024, indicating a significant decline in foreign currency inflows. The ruble-based MOEX Russia index closed 3.2% lower on Friday as investors weighed the risks associated with the impending sanctions package from the EU and the US ahead of the national holiday.\n\n<br>\n\n### Turkey\n\n**Turkey's lira held steady amidst central bank decisions.** Turkey's lira remained unchanged throughout the week amidst a balancing act between the hawkish stance of Türkiye’s central bank and the US Federal Reserve. In its scheduled monetary policy meeting on Thursday, Türkiye’s central bank maintained its key interest rate, the one-week repo auction rate, at 45.0%, as widely expected.

One sentence to summerize is Tuekey want to maxmise its interests in the need for Sweden joinning NATO for more safety.</u>** \n\n#### <br>\n\n## Dynamic Relationship from WW1\n\n<br>\n\n### Reason for WW1\n\n<br>\n\nWhen delving into NATO-related issues, a pivotal historical juncture that demands attention is the era of World War I, a transformative period that left an indelible mark on the contours of the Eurasian continent. This global conflict, fundamentally catalyzed by the ascension of Germany's power, ushered in a substantial reconfiguration of geopolitical dynamics across Eurasia.\n\n<br>\n\nThe ignition point of World War I, rooted in the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Serbia, acted as a mere trigger in a sequence of events that had been set in motion long before. The prerequisites for this trigger were meticulously laid out, with two overarching factors steering the course: **<u>feasibility and conflicting interests between Germany and its neighboring nations.</u>**\n\n<br>\n\nFirstly, the conflict of interests between Germany and its neighboring countries, particularly Britain and France, played a pivotal role. The colonialist pursuits of Britain and France had yielded substantial wealth, while Germany, along with Austria and Italy, found themselves marginalized in the imperialist division of resources. By the eve of World War I, Germany had already attained an industrial prowess surpassing even that of Britain, prompting strategic recalibration through war—an endeavor to reshape the geopolitical landscape and assert influence. \n\n<br>\n\nSecondly, the feasibility of war was facilitated by the rapid development of new weapons and equipment during that era, coinciding with the industrialization of several nations,especially german's industrilization. This convergence created a volatile environment where military capabilities were advancing alongside geopolitical ambitions.\n\n<br>\n\nMore precisely for the 2 reasons, the next is around the conflcting interests and the expansion of armaments. \n\n<br>\n\n**<u>Germany ongoing conflicting interests with its neighboring nations. </u>** Germany, situated in Central Europe, has endured long period of division and historical strife, which is the best fertile land for nationalism. Before WW1, Britain's expansive empire, where the sun never set, sought to protect its global interests. Germany, as a rising power yearning for its \"land in the sun,\" not only expanding in Europe but vying for overseas colonies, resources, and markets. The late colonial ambitions of Germany, lacking vast unclaimed territories, set the stage for conflict with existing colonial powers. The naval arms race between Britain and Germany further exacerbated tensions.\n\n<br>\n\nSimultaneously, economic struggles brewed between France and Germany, rooted in the geographic mismatch of iron-rich eastern France and coal-rich western Germany. Industrialists from both countries hoped to use a victorious war to unify the entire region under their own control.\n\n<br>\n\nRussia's ambitions in the Balkans collided with Germany's eastward expansion, while its maneuvers aimed at destabilizing the Austrian Empire exacerbated tensions. The intricate alliances and enmities weaved a complex geopolitical fabric, where the enemy of one's enemy often became a reluctant friend. Complex alliances among Russia, Britain, France emerged, driven by shared enemies.\n\n<br>\n\n<u>**Escalating Arms Race**</u>. In the years preceding the war, the acceleration of armaments reached a fever pitch. Major powers, including Germany, France, and Britain, intensified military preparations. In 1913, a major tax levied by Germany to raise special military expenditures amounted to fifty million pounds. At the same time, France extended the period of military service from two to three years, and Russia extended the period of military service by six months.  The exorbitant spending, coupled with an extension of military service and escalating naval construction plans, created an atmosphere where war seemed inevitable.\n\n<br>\n\nThe years preceding 1914 were marked by a series of crises, each capable of catalyzing a major war. Disputes over Morocco, Bosnia, Tripoli, and the Balkan Wars created tensions that, once overcome, birthed new conflicts. While the Balkans cannot be solely deemed the primary cause of World War I, the diplomatic deterioration in the region became a crucial factor. \n\n<br>\n\nIn essence, the start of World War I was not an isolated incident but the culmination of a complex interplay of geopolitical forces, industrial advancements, and conflicting imperial ambitions once they achived their unification. \n\n<br>\n\nWhile my advocacy for peace is unwavering, I recognize that the world operates under the sway of strength rather than humanitarian ideals—often validated through the harrowing language of blood and tears. Germany's engagement in two wars finds its roots in its formidable strength, a force that allowed it to compete on the global stage. In the pursuit of territorial ambitions, war, albeit destructive, presented itself as a straightforward means, as the acquisition of land was not up for negotiation.\n\n<br>\n\nIndeed, Germany has the capability to compete with other nations, even as a late comer. Germany's rapid ascent as a late-developing country, surpassing the United Kingdom in economic scale and technological prowess, stems from the advantages inherent in being a latecomer. Yet, the drawbacks are unmistakable, particularly the tendency to be blinded by self-achievement, fostering a misguided belief in the inherent superiority of the nation. Germany, unlike other late-developing nations in the imitation stage for technology transfer and market expansion, led the world in science and invention. Moreover, its contributions to philosophy, academics, literature, and the arts, though constituting soft power, were globally renowned. The pride Germany felt during this era, though potentially harmful, was not entirely unfounded. Since then, many late-developing countries have failed to reach such heights, or even fall behind. As for its failure in World War, Germany's geographical position posed both advantages and disadvantages. While its central location in Europe surrounded by major nations presented wartime challenges, it positioned Germany as a formidable trading power during peacetime, with access to both land and sea routes. The sea, however, imposed severe restrictions on Germany's navy, highlighting the delicate balance between geographical advantages and wartime limitations.\n\n<br>\n\nThis international relations paradigm, deeply rooted in European history, posits that the rise and fall of nations are intimately linked to war. Any ascending power is perceived as a challenge, determined not by intentions but by strength—an inherent desire for development or dominating rights shared by all nations. \n\n<br>\n\n## Post War\n\n<br>\n\n**<u>After WW2, Post-Cold War as U.S. and Russia diverged strategically, with Russia initially leaning towards NATO amid disintegration but later pivoting to the East due to China's rise, reshaping global power dynamics.</u>**\n\n<br>\n\n### Post-Cold War\n\n<br>\n\nPost cold war set the two major power seperately in East and West, so inevitably Sino-Soviet should deteriorate. \n\n<br>\n\nBetween 1950 and 1963, often dubbed the \"honeymoon period\" of Sino-Soviet relations, both nations inked a series of agreements spanning trade, higher education, nuclear technology, and industry. The Soviet Union's extensive support for China during this era included military involvement in the Korean War, where Chinese troops directly confronted the United Nations forces led by the United States. This shared military endeavor solidified China's international alignment towards the Soviet Union, albeit temporarily. However, the euphoria dissipated in 1963, when official negotiations in Moscow between the Soviet and Chinese Communist Parties acknowledged irreconcilable differences. The ensuing tension escalated into border conflicts and military clashes in 1969.\n\n<br>\n\nInevitably, after the rise of \"revised Sovietism\",  The Soviet Union deployed millions of troops in strategic locations, attempting to create a Sino-Soviet buffer zone. Ambitious endeavors in regions such as Outer Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Afghanistan underscored the geopolitical complexity. Meanwhile, Vietnam, under Le Duan's leadership, adopted a pro-Soviet, anti-Chinese stance. In response, China pursued diplomatic outreach to nations like Nepal and North Korea while fostering improved relations with Japan and the United States, particularly in the context of heightened tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The United States wanted to contain the power of the Soviet Union.\n\n<br>\n\nThe U.S. extended Marshall Plans in the Western world, emphasizing long-term interests and the establishment of a new world order. Concurrently, the Soviet Union wielded force to redraw territorial lines. **<u>Current complex interplay between China and US echoed historical patterns</u>**, creating a global landscape not entirely divorced from its past, yet distinct in its own right. As the geopolitical chessboard continues to evolve, echoes of the past resonate in the present, shaping the intricate dance of nations on the world stage.\n\n<br>\n\n### Soviet Union's Disintegration\n\n<br>\n\nFollowing the Soviet Union's disintegration in 1991, Russia, under Yeltsin, faced economic challenges, political corruption, and regional issues like Chechen independence. Seeking stability, **<u>Yeltsin pursued a pro-Western strategy, expressing interest in joining NATO in 1991</u>**. However, Western \"shock therapy\" policies and perceived containment efforts strained relations. In 1999, NATO's bombing campaign in Yugoslavia deepened tensions, leading to Russia's failed attempt to join NATO.\n\n<br>\n\nPutin, succeeding Yeltsin, initially aimed to improve relations. In 2001, Russia reapplied to NATO, but under George W. Bush, the U.S. declared Russia a strategic competitor. NATO's eastward expansion intensified, fueling Russo-NATO tensions. Despite Putin's proposal in 2008 to join NATO, the U.S. remained skeptical, fearing impure motives. The Russo-Georgian War in 2008 further strained relations, dashing hopes of Russian NATO membership. NATO's continual expansion, coupled with U.S. hesitations, exacerbated tensions. \n\n<br>\n\n### Rise of China\n\n<br>\n\nNATO's continuous expansion, coupled with Western hesitation and the rise of China, exacerbated tensions, ultimately contributing to recent conflicts, including the war between Russia and Ukraine. Therefore, the war in Ukraine is not a whim, but a dynamic change in the entire East and West.\n\n<br>\n\nThe onset of the Russo-Ukrainian war has spurred Finland and Sweden's fervent desire to join NATO, indicating a shared perception of deteriorating international relations. Both nations, traditionally neutral, opt for NATO membership as a strategic move driven by the belief that a collective security framework is essential in the face of geopolitical uncertainties. This shift underscores a pragmatic calculation of common interests, as Finland and Sweden anticipate bilateral benefits within NATO rather than maintaining their traditional status as neutral countries. The quest for NATO membership reflects a strategic repositioning to navigate the changing dynamics of international relations amidst the Russo-Ukrainian conflict.\n\n<br>\n\n## Dependency Theory\n\n<br>\n\nExamining historical patterns, the recurring challenge in Eurasia lies in **<u>constant conflicts between core and peripheral countries.</u>** Peripheral nations, like Turkey and Hungary, find themselves in a delicate position, far from the centers of power. The optimal strategy for these countries involves avoiding allegiance to a single side forcefully. Instead, it is advantageous to weaken both sides unless crucial to a specific party. \n\n<br>\n\nLoyalty levels in the relationships between core and peripheral countries fluctuate. Marginalized nations, less favored, inevitably experience exploitation, conflicts, and shifts in their stance. National interests, often unspoken at the individual level, create a web of ever-changing relationships between countries.**<u> In this arena, there are no eternal friends, only eternal interests. </u>** The dynamics, be it war or trade frictions, are devoid of morality, driven solely by the responsibility to millions of people. Peace, in this context, rests on a nation's strength, not humanitarian ideals.\n\n<br>\n\nIn the quest for European hegemony, some countries find themselves stuck in the middle, distant from rising core nations, with their interests oscillating in uncertainty. Finland, wedged between Sweden and Tsarist Russia, or Poland and Ukraine, caught between Russia and Germany, exemplify this precarious positioning. Turkey, straddling Asia, Africa, and Europe, faces an even more complex geopolitical challenge. \n\n<br>\n\n**<u>Peripheral countries must strategically position themselves.</u>** Some, like Poland, lean towards pro-European and American stances, while others, like Finland and Sweden, traditionally preferred military neutrality. The Russo-Ukrainian war prompted Sweden to reconsider its alliance policy. \n\n<br>Alternatively, countries like Turkey may choose a disruptive path to maximize their interests, echoing the historical sentiment captured in the TV series \"Yes, Prime Minister\" regarding British foreign policy's goal of dividing Europe. \n\n<br>\n\nTV series lines as followed: Minister, Britain has had the same foreign policy objectives for at least the last 500 year to create a disunited Europe. In that cause, we have fought with the Dutch against the Spanish, with the Germans against the French, with the French and Italians against the Germans, and with the French against the Germans and Italians. Divide and rule , you see. We had to break the whole thing up, but that wouldn't work, so we had to get inside. The foreign office is pro-Europe, because its really anti-Europe. The civil service was united in its desire to make sure that common market didn't work, that's why we were into it. If not, why are we pressing for an increase in the membership? Well, for the same reason, it is just like the United Nations in fact. The more members it has, the more arquments it can stir up, the more futile and impotent it becomes. What appalling cynicism, which is called diplomacy. \n\n<br>\n\nCharacterizing pro-European actions as serving anti-European objectives may be biased. The European Union's common market indeed brings substantial benefits to its member states during favorable conditions. It facilitates market flow and fosters market expansion, enhancing economic prosperity. However, the fairness of the global landscape is multifaceted, akin to Germany's less-than-ideal geographical locationd during wartime, better than ideal during peacetime. To fully embrace the advantages of EU membership, member states must be prepared to make certain compromises when circumstances demand it.\n\n<br>\n\nNeutral countries, exemplified by Switzerland, employ an \"armed neutrality strategy. Switzerland, nestled between France and Germany, has perfected the art of neutrality, acting as a crucial buffer during times of conflict. Its strategic positioning allowed it to facilitate military preparations for both Germany and France, offering refuge to French nobles and safeguarding their assets. Switzerland, aware of its military limitations, builds itself into a hedgehog. Its armed populace, universal military service, and strategic Alpine location create a formidable defense. This neutral stance allows Switzerland to act as a buffer, deterring potential invaders by making conquest more costly than the gains. \n\n<br>\n\n**<u>So, the reason for why sweden wanna join NATO and the opposition to Sweden's NATO membership with Hungary and Turkey may rely on the both side intention of seeking greater interests.</u>** Excuses could be motivations may stem from response of Swedish comments for Hungary's democracy or Turkey's accusations against Sweden sheltering Kurdish militants. More specific, Turkey is negotiating for more F weapons from US for the vote of passing Sweden to joining NATO. The peripheral countries' goal remains securing resources amidst core countries' competition. Diplomatic relations and alliances may shift, demonstrating the pragmatic pursuit of national interests in a world dominated by the ebb and flow of geopolitical realities. \n\n<br>\n\n## Takeaways\n\n<br>\n\n**<u>Be more cautious for the potential escalating geopolitical issues.</u>** Examining the map, it's evident that the small marginal countries at the crossroads of the Eurasian continent are aligning with distinct sides, representing broader Eastern and Western forces led by the United States and China. The looming possibility of a conflict between these major powers, whether initiated by the dominant United States or challenged by the latecomer China, increases as compromise becomes elusive. Both sides may need a war to set the new order. Current events, such as the Hamas-Israel conflict, tensions in the Red Sea, and disputes in the Taiwan Strait, suggest a path toward realization. \n\n<br>\n\n**<u>Peace and Love. </u>** While nobody wishes for war, history has shown that it's an inevitable part of the human journey. In times of turmoil, peripheral countries prioritize their interests over emotions, ready to sever ties or forge close collaborations. The state machine, with its collective leadership, remains unwavering, serving the interests of millions. In this context, personal sentiments and moral unity take a back seat to the responsibility of individuals who contribute to the government, even as positions change. The country, acting as a rational entity, demands allegiance. For core countries, the pursuit of enduring love and peace remains paramount. Those in positions of influence bear the responsibility to extend kindness, having achieved their aspirations. A plea is made to contribute to global tranquility, recognizing the impact of their elevated positions on the world stage. In a world brimming with complexities, fostering peace becomes a shared imperative.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n### Books to Read\n\nContinental power and maritime checks and balances\n\nWhy is Buddhism true?\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n### \n","tags":["Events","Econ"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Econ Events - Why Argentina Needs Milei","url":"/2024/01/22/econ_jan22/","content":"\n# \n\n## Milei's Radical Agenda\n\n<br>Picture this: a presidential candidate emerges with a platform that is as unconventional as it is bold. This candidate champions ideas such as the dollarization of the economy, drastic cuts in state spending, opposition to established norms like sex education and legal abortion, legalization of organ selling, relaxation of gun control, and even drug legalization. In many countries, such propositions might be dismissed as too radical or contentious. Yet, in Argentina, this very set of proposals has propelled someone to the presidency. \n\n<br>\n\nThe question then arises: Why would the people of Argentina choose such a leader? It's a mistake to dismiss this decision as irrational. As an advocate for the rational actor hypothesis, I propose to delve into the complex web of reasons behind Javier Milei's ascent to power. What does his victory reveal about the current state of Argentina's society, economy, and political landscape? Let's explore the underlying factors that made Milei's presidency not just possible, but perhaps even inevitable. **<u>One sentence to summerize: when population are sick of both parties, they tend to vote for the unorthdox president who may have potential to rescue their life with radical proposal, including Argentina, Ukraine, etc. </u>** \n\n<br>\n\n## Argentina's Tumultuous Path\n\n<br>\n\nTracing Argentina's path to its current state requires a journey back in time, well before World War II. Known as the **World's Breadbasket**, Argentina boasted vast pampas, fertile lands, and a climate favorable for agriculture. During this era, its economy rivaled that of Britain and the emerging power of the United States.\n\n<br>\n\nHowever, despite avoiding direct involvement in World Wars I and II, Argentina couldn't escape economic turmoil. The withdrawal of British investments, which constituted a significant portion of its economy, exacerbated **Argentina's financial woes**. The country grappled with incomplete industrialization, relying heavily on imported agricultural machinery from Britain and the United States,highlighting the country's dependency on foreign technology.\n\n<br>\n\nWhen the populace struggles to meet basic needs such as food, a shift in governance becomes almost a certainty, mostly during financial crisis.  The ensuing era saw the rise of military governments. This period was marked by a strategic choice between authoritarianism and supporting unions to ensure political stability. The latter option was notably visible during **Peronism**. The government increased public spending and overhauled infrastructure for the populace's benefit, but these measures led to tight national finances and subsequent money printing. By around 1950, inflation in Argentina soared to 40%, outpacing wage growth, which lagged behind at 30%. This raises the question: Is the pursuit of social welfare without a robust economic foundation genuinely sustainable?\n\n<br>\n\nSuccessive governments post-Peronism continued to grapple with this **dilemma**, often opting to enhance national welfare to secure votes, despite the burgeoning fiscal deficit. This deficit was frequently addressed through increasing foreign debt. From 1990 to 2022, Argentina's total M2 money supply skyrocketed from 800 million to 134 trillion pesos. Repaying this debt through inflation led to extreme economic turbulence, culminating in a staggering 20,000% inflation rate post the Falklands War in 1982.\n\n<br>\n\nOver these tumultuous 70 years, Argentina's socio-economic landscape was primed for a radical change. This set the stage for the rise of Javier Milei, a candidate who capitalized on the public's growing discontent, eventually being elected as the new president with 56% support.\"\n\n<br>\n\n## The Roots of Milei's Triumph\n\n<br>\n\nJavier Milei is far from your typical politician. His eclectic background as a DJ, radio commentator, and football player, coupled with his forthright criticism of societal norms, government inaction, and Argentina's long-standing economic woes, sets him apart. **Milei's direct and unorthodox approach has resonated deeply with many Argentinians, his policies striking a chord in a society yearning for change.** His solutions to Argentina's challenges were radical yet straightforward: Rising Inflation? Response: Abolish the peso. Government Inefficiency? Response: Disband the government. Stagnant Wages? Response: Eliminate taxes. Economic Downturn? Response: Privatize state-owned assets. Social Security and Healthcare Concerns? Response: Legalize prostitution and organ selling, while upholding gun rights and opposing abortion.\n\n<br>\n\nThese policies, while controversial, seemed to offer a direct and immediate response to Argentina's deep-rooted problems. This boldness in policy-making positioned Milei not just as a leader but as a potential savior in the eyes of many. Was Milei's election a surprise? Not really. It appears more as a logical outcome under the circumstances. Faced with persisting errors in governance, it seems the electorate preferred to entrust the nation's future to an unconventional figure, embracing the potential for unforeseen outcomes over the continuation of known failures.\n\n<br>\n\nWait a second, Milei's approach echoes that of Margaret Thatcher during the Falklands War era. Thatcher's policies, focused on cutting social welfare, privatizing state assets, and boosting economic efficiency, were transformative for the UK, albeit with mixed outcomes. refine this expression :Mrs. Thatcher was the **savior of the capitalists** of that era, but she was also the **living judge of the miserable people**. Similarly, Milei's strategies might spur short-term enterprise growth in Argentina, akin to Thatcher's impact in the UK. However, there are concerns about the long-term consequences: increased wealth disparity, rising unemployment, diminished trade union rights, and potential social unrest.\n\n<br>\n\n**Power abhors a vacuum.** As the government recedes from key sectors under Milei's administration, unregulated capital, conglomerates, and even underground organizations might fill the void. The freedom to bear arms, as proposed by Milei, could instill a semblance of order, albeit outside the traditional governmental framework.\n\n<br>\n\nWhat lies ahead for Argentina and its people under Milei's leadership remains uncertain. Yet, every nation has its trials and tribulations. For Argentina, this may be a period of profound transformation – an epoch where resilience is tested, and new foundations are laid. As Argentina navigates these uncharted waters, one can only hope for a future that fortifies the nation without compromising its core values. \n\n<br>\n\n## God bless Argentina.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n### \n","tags":["Events","Econ"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Stocks Recap - Japanese Carmakers Excel, Auto Sector Challenges, TSM and ASML Lead","url":"/2024/01/21/stocks_jan21/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **For Carmakers, Japanese stocks, led by Toyota's 2.87% gains, outperformed as the US Federal Reserve's firm stance favored the market.

On the flip side, a robust rebound was hindered by abundant stocks in major global warehouses. Data from the Shanghai Futures Exchange revealed an 8% increase in inventories in key Chinese warehouses, reaching 33,130 tonnes in the first week of January. The delicate balance between economic uncertainties and inventory levels continues to influence the trajectory of copper and raises cautious optimism about the commodity's near-term performance.\n\n<br>\n\n**Aluminum futures extended their decline to under $2,178 per tonne cuz of the resumed supply from Guinea.**  The earlier surge last year was due to a bauxite supply disruption from Guinea, the world's third-largest bauxite exporter. An explosion at a fuel depot in Guinea halted industrial activity, driving aluminum prices up. The recent retreat can be attributed to strong investments from the UAE in the infrastructure sector, alleviating investor concerns. Additionally, the People's Bank of China's (PBOC) policy to inject 350 billion into state banks is expected to bolster manufacturing activity, providing short-term support to aluminum prices.\n\n<br>\n\n**Nickel futures continued its decline for oversupply concerns.** Nickel futures fell below $16,500 per tonne, nearing three-year lows, due to abundant supply from top producers—Indonesia, Philippines, and China. The International Nickel Study Group forecasts a surplus of 223,000 metric tons in 2023, with expectations of widening to 239,000 metric tons in 2024, emphasizing the persistent imbalance between supply and demand in the nickel market.\n\n<br>\n\n**Tin futures rebounded to 24,780 from the one-month low of 24,430 touched on January 10th, but still at a high level, influenced by lingering expectations for stronger supply, following a three-month high of $25,680 reached on December 28th.** Tin prices were upheld by the prolonged production halt in Myanmar's Wa region since August, responsible for 70% of Myanmar's output and a significant portion of China's tin supply. With China compelled to seek alternative sources, the Republic of Congo became a primary supplier. However, adverse weather conditions and infrastructure challenges in Congo towards the end of the year hampered output, contributing to elevated tin prices in the market.\n\n<br>\n\n**Lithium dip this week in such restocking season.** Lithium carbonate prices, hitting CNY 95,500 per tonne since last week, as the market somewhat found an equilibrium of ample supply and muted demand, which marked the lowest since August 2021, plummeting over 80% in the past year due to an escalating oversupply. Pessimism surrounding electric vehicle sales in China constrained lithium demand during the typical restocking season for battery manufacturers. Consequently, major industry players now project the next lithium deficit to emerge only in 2028, a sharp departure from earlier expectations. Previous investments aimed at increasing supply may propel the global carbonate equivalent supply to surge by 40% in 2024, as per UBS, intensifying the existing surplus.\n\n<br>\n\n| Future   | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY    |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| Copper   | 3.78           | 1.26   | -2.81   | -10.92 |\n| Aluminum | 2178           | -1.87  | -2.81   | -16.57 |\n| Zinc     | 2473           | -1.63  | -3.89   | -27.70 |\n| Nickel   | 15918          | -1.61  | -3.63   | -45.39 |\n| Tin      | 25233          | 3.27   | 1.66    | -13.29 |\n| Lithium  | 95500          | 0      | -2.05   | -80.00 |\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n### Agriculture :\n\n<br>\n\n**Soybean futures drop on oversupply.** Soybean futures dropped to $12.2 per bushel this week, marking the lowest point in almost three months and extending a 15.1% loss from 2023 due to anticipated robust production. Despite weather challenges, Brazil is poised for a record-breaking soybean harvest. Additionally, Argentina is exploring the potential to double its soybean output, while Paraguay and Uruguay also indicate substantial increases.\n\n<br>\n\n**Wheat futures saw a decline, slipping below $5.93 per bushel in January, marking the lowest point in over a month.** The drop is attributed to sustained expectations of robust global supply. The USDA's upward revision of global wheat supply forecasts for the current marketing year, driven by increased production and beginning stocks, played a significant role. Ample stocks in Ukrainian silos, coupled with higher production in Russia reaching 91 million tonnes, just shy of the record set last year, contributed to an all-time high of 51 million tonnes available for export. This substantial surplus, combined with strong harvests in Canada and Australia, resulted in heightened export forecasts, solidifying the position of these key producers in the global wheat market.\n\n<br>**Malaysian palm oil futures held steady around MYR 3,939 per tonne, marking the seventh consecutive session of gains and reaching a six-week high.** This upward trajectory is attributed to the strength in rival edible oils on the Chicago Board of Trade and an increase in crude oil prices amid deepening Middle East tensions. The weekly performance reflects a nearly 2% jump, driven by growing speculation that India, a major buyer, may escalate palm oil purchases due to concerns over the availability of sunflower and soybean oils amid tensions in the Red Sea. The confluence of global factors and regional demand fears continues to propel Malaysian palm oil futures to higher levels.\n\n<br>\n\n| Future   | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY    |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| Soybeans | 1213           | -0.09  | -7.79   | -19.47 |\n| Wheat    | 593            | -0.05  | -2.79   | -20.03 |\n| Palm Oil | 3939           | 2.15   | 4.26    | 1.21   |\n\n---\n\n<br>\n","tags":["Commodity","Weekly Recap"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Regional Markets - Currency Declined As Dollar Strengthed","url":"/2024/01/20/mmarket_jan20/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **In the emerging markets, most currencies faced decline due to the strengthened dollar resulting from a hawkish Fed Reserve governor.Mexico's peso faces pressure on policy outlook, while Brazil grapples with industrial contraction.** \n\n- **The Indian rupee held firm amid global uncertainties, benefiting from strong domestic economic data and central bank intervention.

The 7.3% GDP growth in the 2023-24 fiscal year surpassed expectations, reinforcing positive sentiments for Indian equities and sovereign debt.

The Russian finance ministry shifted to forex sales, planning to sell 16.7 billion rubles ($189.5 million) daily in the latter half of January. The ruble-based MOEX Russia index, which had surged to 1-1/2-month highs, declined to 3166 on Friday for a second consecutive session. Mixed dynamics were observed over the week, with all sectors ending in the red amid reduced investor activity and a light macroeconomic agenda.\n\n<br>\n\n### Turkey\n\n**The Turkish lira continued its downward spiral** reaching an unprecedented low of 30.2 per USD, prompted by remarks from central bank chief Erkan signaling an early end to the monetary policy tightening cycle and strengthed dollar. Despite Turkey's annual inflation soaring to an alarming 64.77% in December, with expectations of a continued upward trajectory in the coming months, Erkan's comments added to concerns. The substantial increase in the minimum wage, a contributing factor to inflation, aimed at alleviating living costs ahead of the upcoming municipal elections in March. With the net minimum wage for 2024 raised to 17,002 liras ($578), the Turkish lira has witnessed a staggering decline of over a third in the past year and more than 80% over the last five years, reflecting the deepening economic challenges facing Turkey.\n\n<br>\n\n| Markets  | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY   |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| USD/RUB  | 88.17          | 0.24   | -1.65   | 29.20 |\n| USD/TRY  | 30.20          | 0.48   | 3.77    | 61.05 |\n| MOEX     | 3166           | -0.59  | 1.99    | 46.14 |\n| BIST 100 | 7997           | 0.13   | 4.36    | 45.65 |\n| TURKEY-B | 24.88          | 0.57   | 2.32    | 14.96 |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :\n\n| Markets | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY   |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| USD/CHF | 0.86           | 1.85   | 0.63    | -5.69 |\n| USD/KRW | 1333           | 1.56   | 2.35    | 8.53  |\n| USD/NGN | 890            | -7.00  | 8.01    | 95.80 |\n| USD/ZAR | 19             | 2.24   | 3.85    | 11.20 |\n| TAIEX   | 17682          | 0.96   | 0.26    | 14.12 |\n| NSE     | 94538          | 13.84  | 28.80   | 79.75 |\n\n---\n","tags":["Weekly Recap","Regional Markets"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Markets Recap - Navigate Earnings Impact, Central Bank Signals","url":"/2024/01/20/macro_jan20/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **U.S. markets fluctuated on early earnings impact, tech resilience lifted stocks, bond rates stabilized on FED signals.European stocks faced declines amid a hawkish ECB stance and mixed economic signals.** \n\n- **Japan's stock market surged on a weakening yen and positive inflation data, while China faced unexpected declines due to weak economic indicators.**\n\n- **The dollar strengthened, buoyed by robust US data and a hawkish Fed, impacting the yen, which weakened as Finance Minister Suzuki emphasized stable currency moves; oil prices held gains amid Middle East tensions and positive demand outlook, while gold declined on strengthened dollar and Treasury yields.**   \n\n<br>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n### US Market : <br><br>\n\n**The U.S. stock market witnessed volatility as the fourth-quarter earnings season unfolded.** Boeing's earnings report, coupled with delivery concerns for its 737 MAX airliners, initially led to declines.

Despite the People's Bank of China injecting CNY 350 billion into other state policy banks, indicating continued government support for the economy, investor caution persists regarding China's recovery. On the flip side, a robust rebound was hindered by abundant stocks in major global warehouses. Data from the Shanghai Futures Exchange revealed an 8% increase in inventories in key Chinese warehouses, reaching 33,130 tonnes in the first week of January. The delicate balance between economic uncertainties and inventory levels continues to influence the trajectory of copper and raises cautious optimism about the commodity's near-term performance.\n\n<br>\n\n**Aluminum futures extended their decline to under $2,250 per tonne**  The earlier surge last year was due to a bauxite supply disruption from Guinea, the world's third-largest bauxite exporter. An explosion at a fuel depot in Guinea halted industrial activity, driving aluminum prices up. The recent retreat can be attributed to strong investments from the UAE in the infrastructure sector, alleviating investor concerns. Additionally, the People's Bank of China's (PBOC) policy to inject 350 billion into state banks is expected to bolster manufacturing activity, providing short-term support to aluminum prices.\n\n<br>\n\n**Nickel futures continued its decline for oversupply concerns.** Nickel futures fell below $16,500 per tonne, nearing three-year lows, due to abundant supply from top producers—Indonesia, Philippines, and China. The International Nickel Study Group forecasts a surplus of 223,000 metric tons in 2023, with expectations of widening to 239,000 metric tons in 2024, emphasizing the persistent imbalance between supply and demand in the nickel market.\n\n<br>\n\n**Tin continued its decline for oversupply concerns.** Tin futures experienced a dip this week below 24,500, influenced by lingering expectations for stronger supply, following a three-month high of $25,680 reached on December 28th. Tin prices were upheld by the prolonged production halt in Myanmar's Wa region since August, responsible for 70% of Myanmar's output and a significant portion of China's tin supply. With China compelled to seek alternative sources, the Republic of Congo became a primary supplier. However, adverse weather conditions and infrastructure challenges in Congo towards the end of the year hampered output, contributing to elevated tin prices in the market.\n\n<br>\n\n**Lithium dip this week in such restocking season.** Lithium carbonate prices, hitting CNY 95,500 per tonne this week, as the market somewhat found an equilibrium of ample supply and muted demand, which marked the lowest since August 2021, plummeting over 80% in the past year due to an escalating oversupply. Pessimism surrounding electric vehicle sales in China constrained lithium demand during the typical restocking season for battery manufacturers. Consequently, major industry players now project the next lithium deficit to emerge only in 2028, a sharp departure from earlier expectations. Previous investments aimed at increasing supply may propel the global carbonate equivalent supply to surge by 40% in 2024, as per UBS, intensifying the existing surplus.\n\n<br>\n\n| Future   | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY    |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| Copper   | 3.74           | -1.14  | -1.14   | -11.11 |\n| Aluminum | 2219           | -2.40  | 3.69    | -14.49 |\n| Zinc     | 2513           | -1.93  | 3.56    | -24.40 |\n| Nickel   | 16189          | 0.09   | -1.22   | -39.67 |\n| Tin      | 24435          | -3.40  | 0.31    | -8.87  |\n| Lithium  | 95500          | -1.04  | -2.05   | -80.12 |\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n### Agriculture :\n\n<br>\n\n**Soybean futures drop on oversupply.** Soybean futures dropped to $12.2 per bushel this week, marking the lowest point in almost three months and extending a 15.1% loss from 2023 due to anticipated robust production. Despite weather challenges, Brazil is poised for a record-breaking soybean harvest. Additionally, Argentina is exploring the potential to double its soybean output, while Paraguay and Uruguay also indicate substantial increases.\n\n<br>\n\n**Wheat futures saw a decline, slipping below $5.95 per bushel in January, marking the lowest point in over a month.** The drop is attributed to sustained expectations of robust global supply. The USDA's upward revision of global wheat supply forecasts for the current marketing year, driven by increased production and beginning stocks, played a significant role. Ample stocks in Ukrainian silos, coupled with higher production in Russia reaching 91 million tonnes, just shy of the record set last year, contributed to an all-time high of 51 million tonnes available for export. This substantial surplus, combined with strong harvests in Canada and Australia, resulted in heightened export forecasts, solidifying the position of these key producers in the global wheat market.\n\n<br>**Malaysian palm oil futures held steady around MYR 3,856 per tonne, marking the seventh consecutive session of gains and reaching a five-week high.** This upward trajectory is attributed to the strength in rival edible oils on the Chicago Board of Trade and an increase in crude oil prices amid deepening Middle East tensions. The weekly performance reflects a nearly 4% jump, driven by growing speculation that India, a major buyer, may escalate palm oil purchases due to concerns over the availability of sunflower and soybean oils amid tensions in the Red Sea. The confluence of global factors and regional demand fears continues to propel Malaysian palm oil futures to higher levels.\n\n<br>\n\n| Future   | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY    |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| Soybeans | 1223           | -2.65  | -7.79   | -19.95 |\n| Wheat    | 596            | -3.25  | -1.53   | -19.87 |\n| Palm Oil | 3856           | 4.73   | 5.07    | 0.39   |\n\n---\n\n<br>\n","tags":["Commodity","Weekly Recap"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Regional Markets - Resilience and Challenges Across Brazil, Mexico, India, Russia, and Turkey","url":"/2024/01/13/mmarket_jan14/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **Brazil and Mexico exhibited distinct paths. Brazil's real strengthened on the back of a record trade surplus and hawkish signals, while Mexico's peso appreciated amid slightly exceeded inflation expectations and positive growth projections.** \n\n- **India's rupee marked a four-month high, supported by robust GDP growth and central bank interventions. Russia's ruble strengthened past 89 per USD due to central bank actions and rising oil prices from geopolitical events. In contrast, Turkey faced economic challenges, with the lira hitting a record low of 30.1 per USD, triggered by central bank signals, surging inflation, and a substantial minimum wage increase.** \n\n<br>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n### Latin America : <br><br>\n\n### Brazil\n\n**Brazil's resilient real amid trade surplus despite economic challenges.** In Brazil, the recent PMI reading for December pointed to a contraction, primarily fueled by ongoing declines in operating conditions and heightened cost pressures. Headline inflation, standing at 4.62% in December, surpassed market expectations of 4.54%. While the central bank is anticipated to implement its fifth consecutive 50bps cut this month, the persistent risk of upside price growth may prompt policymakers to temper their dovish signals, leading to a potentially more cautious approach to Brazilian disinflation. This shift in expectations toward a more hawkish stance was evident in the currency market, where the real appreciated by 0.42% against the US dollar this week. Additionally, for the long term, Brazil's currency exhibited resilience, attributed to the country's record trade surplus of $98.8 billion in 2023, marking a substantial 60.6% increase from the previous year. This surplus, driven by expanded exports in agriculture and extractive industries, has not only bolstered foreign currency inflows but also contributed to the strength of the real. As Brazil navigates these economic challenges, policymakers face a delicate balance in responding to both contractionary forces and inflationary pressures.\n\n<br>\n\nThe Ibovespa, however, experienced a 0.7% loss, initially influenced by lower oil prices earlier in the week. The later disruption of commercial routes in the Red Sea due to U.S. and UK airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen led to a surge in oil prices by week-end, benefitting Petrobras and ultimately contributing to a 0.3% increase in the Ibovespa.\n\n<br>\n\n### Mexico\n\n**In Mexico, mirroring the trend in Brazil, the Mexican peso strengthened, surpassing the 16.86 per USD level.** December's inflation data revealed a month-over-month headline inflation of 0.7%, with a year-over-year rate of 4.7%, slightly exceeding expectations. The central bank is anticipated to maintain a vigilant stance against broader inflation, signaling a reluctance for immediate interest rate cuts until sustained signs of longer-lasting disinflation emerge. Concurrently, the World Bank adjusted Mexico's growth projection for 2024, elevating it from 1.9% to a more optimistic 2.6%. This adjustment underscores the resilience of the Mexican economy in the face of aggressive rate hikes in the previous year, providing a positive outlook for the nation's economic trajectory.<br>\n\nRecent economic indicators further underscored the resilience of the Mexican economy, with business confidence reaching a ten-year high. Additionally, unemployment remained at levels unseen in over twenty years. These factors collectively contribute to a favorable outlook for Mexico's economic stability and growth.\n\n<br>\n\n### Argentina\n\nThe USD to ARS exchange rate increased by 0.07% on Friday for the week. Notably, Argentina's main stock market index, Merval, declined 2.11% this week. \n\n<br>\n\n| Markets    | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY    |\n| ---------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| USD/BRL    | 4.85           | -0.42  | -1.34   | -4.74  |\n| USD/MXN    | 16.86          | -0.03  | -2.17   | -11.09 |\n| USD/ARS    | 816            | 0.47   | 2.01    | 350.21 |\n| IBOVESPA   | 130988         | -0.78  | 1.18    | 18.10  |\n| IPC MEXICO | 55607          | -1.04  | 0.80    | 3.79   |\n| MERVAL     | 1033123        | -2.11  | 2.95    | 326.64 |\n| BRAZIL-B   | 10.59          | 0.02   | -0.32   | -1.72  |\n| MEXICO     | 8.95           | -0.02  | -0.15   | 0.48   |\n\n<br>\n\n### Asia :<br><br>\n\n### India\n\n**Rupee continued its momentum.** In India, the momentum of the Indian rupee continued, appreciating beyond 83 per USD, marking its strongest position in four months. This strengthening trend is attributed to robust economic data and sustained intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). India's GDP growth stood at an impressive 7.3% in the 2023-24 fiscal year, surpassing market expectations and highlighting the resilience of the Indian economy amidst the RBI's tightening cycle in the preceding year. The RBI's consistent intervention in the foreign exchange markets, preventing the rupee from breaching its record low of 83.4, has instilled confidence in investors. This proactive approach by the central bank has contributed to the rupee's positive trajectory, signaling a favorable outlook for India's economic stability.\n\n<br>\n\nThe S&P BSE Sensex climbed 1.2% to close at an all-time high of 72,568 points on Friday, and the NSE Nifty 50 surged by 1.1% to end at a record 21,895 points, led by increases in IT companies, supported by positive quarterly reports from both Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys.\n\n<br>\n\n| Markets | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY   |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| USD/INR | 82.85          | -0.29  | -0.59   | 1.94  |\n| SENSEX  | 72568          | 0.75   | 4.29    | 20.24 |\n\n<br>\n\n### EU :<br><br>\n\n### Russia\n\n**Russian currency and index react positively to the geopolitical tension.** The Russian ruble crossed the 89 per USD mark, reaching its highest level since November's end, propelled by intensified interventions by the central bank and a surge in oil prices following U.S. and UK missile strikes in Yemen. Additionally, the Russian finance ministry announced a shift from forex purchases to sales in the coming weeks, aiming to offset lower revenues from oil and gas in the past month. Higher oil prices, further boosted by Western strikes on Houthi military targets in Yemen, contributed to the positive momentum, reflecting the intricate interplay of global events impacting Russia's currency and economic indicators.\n\n<br>\n\n### Turkey\n\n**The Turkish lira continued its downward spiral** reaching an unprecedented low of 30.1 per USD, prompted by remarks from central bank chief Erkan signaling an early end to the monetary policy tightening cycle. Despite Turkey's annual inflation soaring to an alarming 64.77% in December, with expectations of a continued upward trajectory in the coming months, Erkan's comments added to concerns. The substantial increase in the minimum wage, a contributing factor to inflation, aimed at alleviating living costs ahead of the upcoming municipal elections in March. With the net minimum wage for 2024 raised to 17,002 liras ($578), the Turkish lira has witnessed a staggering decline of over a third in the past year and more than 80% over the last five years, reflecting the deepening economic challenges facing Turkey.\n\n<br>\n\n| Markets  | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY   |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| USD/RUB  | 87.95          | -3.26  | -1.56   | 35.32 |\n| USD/TRY  | 30.11          | 0.97   | 4.02    | 60.32 |\n| MOEX     | 3186           | 1.56   | 5.06    | 44.45 |\n| BIST 100 | 7986           | 4.69   | 6.07    | 60.81 |\n| TURKEY-B | 24.31          | -1.16  | 1.04    | 14.16 |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :\n\n| Markets | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY    |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| USD/CHF | 0.85           | 0.22   | -2.17   | -7.98  |\n| USD/KRW | 1312           | -0.13  | 1.36    | 6.08   |\n| USD/NGN | 957            | 4.82   | 19.33   | 111.68 |\n| USD/ZAR | 18.64          | -0.17  | -0.17   | 11.06  |\n| TAIEX   | 17513          | -0.04  | 0.35    | 18.89  |\n| NSE     | 83043          | 4.24   | 14.86   | 58.53  |\n\n---\n","tags":["Weekly Recap","Regional Markets"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Markets Recap - US Tech-Driven Resilience, EU Rate Speculation, and Diverging Trends in Asia","url":"/2024/01/13/macro_jan13/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **US stocks remained resilient, driven by tech gains, while bond markets fluctuated around expectations of softened financial conditions.

Germany’s DAX recorded a gain of 0.66%, France’s CAC 40 Index inched up by 0.06%, and Italy’s FTSE MIB showed modest upward movement.<br>\n\n**The bond market in Europe experienced volatility** particularly following an interview on Thursday where ECB President Christine Lagarde suggested that the most challenging phase of inflation might be behind, hinting at potential interest rate cuts if inflation falls to the 2% level.

These levels marked their highest in almost 34 years, propelled by a weak yen and the Bank of Japan's dovish monetary policy stance. The BoJ reiterated its commitment to maintaining an ultra-accommodative policy until sustainable inflation, driven by wage growth, materializes. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield struggled to find clear direction, fluctuating around 0.6% throughout the week.<br>\n\n**Persistent concerns about the economy continued to weigh on the stock market.** The Shanghai Composite Index declined by 1.61%, and the blue-chip CSI 300 gave up 1.35%.

Despite the market pricing in an 80% chance of a rate cut in March, the Eurozone, with a more conservative 30% probability, is leaning towards holding rates higher for a longer duration. The euro stabilized above $1.09 with slight gains, reflecting a nuanced market sentiment. Concurrently, the yen lingered at its lowest levels in around a month, weakening beyond JPY 145 against the U.S. dollar, influenced by the Bank of Japan's commitment to maintaining its current monetary policy stance.<br>\n\n**Oil prices exhibited volatility throughout the week.** A more than 2% decline on Monday resulted from sharp price cuts by top exporter Saudi Arabia and increased OPEC output.

This retreat was influenced by a resurgence in the US dollar, which exerted downward pressure on commodity prices. Additionally, profit-taking activities by commodity trading firms contributed to the dip in copper futures. The subdued demand from China further exacerbated the situation, marked by a fourth consecutive month of low Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) readings according to Caixin data. These factors collectively contributed to the weakening of copper prices in the market. \n\n<br>\n\n**Aluminum retreats on supply enhancement, investments, and PBOC support.**  Aluminum futures dropped below 2300 from the eight-month high of 2387 last week in 2023. The earlier surge was due to a bauxite supply disruption from Guinea, the world's third-largest bauxite exporter. An explosion at a fuel depot in Guinea halted industrial activity, driving aluminum prices up. The recent retreat can be attributed to strong investments from the UAE in the infrastructure sector, alleviating investor concerns. Additionally, the People's Bank of China's (PBOC) policy to inject 350 billion into state banks is expected to bolster manufacturing activity, providing short-term support to aluminum prices.\n\n<br>\n\n**Nickel futures dip on oversupply concerns.** Nickel futures fell below $16,500 per tonne, nearing three-year lows, due to abundant supply from top producers—Indonesia, Philippines, and China. The International Nickel Study Group forecasts a surplus of 223,000 metric tons in 2023, with expectations of widening to 239,000 metric tons in 2024, emphasizing the persistent imbalance between supply and demand in the nickel market.\n\n<br>\n\n**Tin dips on dollar strength, easing supply.** Tin futures experienced a dip in the first week, influenced by a strengthening dollar and easing supply concerns from the previous year, following a three-month high of $25,680 reached on December 28th. Despite the decline, tin prices were upheld by the prolonged production halt in Myanmar's Wa region since August, responsible for 70% of Myanmar's output and a significant portion of China's tin supply. With China compelled to seek alternative sources, the Republic of Congo became a primary supplier. However, adverse weather conditions and infrastructure challenges in Congo towards the end of the year hampered output, contributing to elevated tin prices in the market.\n\n<br>\n\n**Lithium remained unchanged this week in such restocking season.** Lithium carbonate prices, hitting CNY 97,500 per tonne in January, marked the lowest since August 2021, plummeting over 80% in the past year due to an escalating oversupply. Pessimism surrounding electric vehicle sales in China constrained lithium demand during the typical restocking season for battery manufacturers. Consequently, major industry players now project the next lithium deficit to emerge only in 2028, a sharp departure from earlier expectations. Previous investments aimed at increasing supply may propel the global carbonate equivalent supply to surge by 40% in 2024, as per UBS, intensifying the existing surplus.\n\n<br>\n\n| Future   | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YTD    |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| Copper   | 3.79           | -2.45  | 1.87    | -3.21  |\n| Aluminum | 2274.50        | -4.59  | 5.86    | -0.91  |\n| Zinc     | 2550.99        | -4.06  | 5.00    | -15.66 |\n| Nickel   | 15835          | -4.02  | -0.66   | -42.62 |\n| Tin      | 24834          | -3.16  | 3.20    | -1.04  |\n| Lithium  | 96500          | 0      | -2.03   | -80.80 |\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n### Agriculture :\n\n<br>\n\n**Soybean futures drop on oversupply.** Soybean futures dropped to $12.6 per bushel in the first week, marking the lowest point in almost three months and extending a 15.1% loss from 2023 due to anticipated robust production. Despite weather challenges, Brazil is poised for a record-breaking soybean harvest. Additionally, Argentina is exploring the potential to double its soybean output, while Paraguay and Uruguay also indicate substantial increases.\n\n<br>\n\n**Wheat futures rebound a little bit on buyer's purchases.** Wheat futures climbed above6.2 per bushel, recovering from the one-month low of 6 on January 3rd, following reports of new purchases from major consumers. The announcement that China was seeking another round of US wheat spurred buying activity from commodity funds. This potential purchase builds on a similar transaction at the end of November, which previously boosted the benchmark to $6.4.\n\n<br>**Plam oil retreated.** Malaysian palm oil futures hovered around MYR 3,700 per tonne as December's end likely saw a decline in Malaysia's palm oil inventories. The reduction can be attributed to diminished production caused by rainy weather and seasonal effects, as reported by a Reuters survey.\n\n<br>\n\n| Future   | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YTD    |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| Soybeans | 1250.25        | -3.34  | -3.49   | -16.23 |\n| Wheat    | 616.27         | -1.87  | 2.72    | -17.11 |\n| Palm Oil | 3682.00        | -1.05  | -0.99   | -9.13  |\n|          |                |        |         |        |\n\n---\n\n<br>\n","tags":["Commodity","Weekly Recap"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Regional Markets - Brazil Stable,Mexico Gains,Challenges for India and Turkey","url":"/2024/01/07/mmarket_jan07/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **This week witnessed Brazilian currency remained stable amid a record trade surplus, while the Brazilian index retreated.

This resilience was attributed to Brazil's record trade surplus of $98.8 billion in 2023, a 60.6% jump from the previous year. The surplus was driven by increased exports in agriculture and extractive industries, boosting foreign currency inflows and supporting the real's strength. In the financial markets, the Brazilian index retreated by 0.5% in the first week, accompanied by a 1.3% drop in Vale's shares.\n\n### Mexico\n\nIn contrast, the Mexican currency demonstrated strength by appreciating to below 16.9 pesos against the USD, registering a 0.45% weekly increase. This positive momentum is attributed to the Banxico minutes, indicating a commitment to tackle the 5.3% inflation recorded in November. The central bank's decision to maintain an overnight interbank interest rate at 11.25% led investors to anticipate a potential interest rate hike.<br>\n\nRecent economic indicators further underscored the resilience of the Mexican economy, with business confidence reaching a ten-year high. Additionally, unemployment remained at levels unseen in over twenty years. These factors collectively contribute to a favorable outlook for Mexico's economic stability and growth.\n\n### Argentina\n\nThe USD to ARS exchange rate increased by 0.46% to 804.7500 on Friday for the week. Notably, Argentina's main stock market index, Merval, demonstrated robust growth, surging by 13.52% since the beginning of 2024, reflecting positive investor sentiment and market performance.\n\n<br>\n\n| Markets    | Friday's Close | Week's Change | YTD    |\n| ---------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|:------:|\n| USD/BRL    | 4.87           | 0.46          | -6.72  |\n| USD/MXN    | 16.88          | -0.45         | -11.75 |\n| USD/ARS    | 812.20         | 0.46          | 353.14 |\n| IBOVESPA   | 132023         | -0.51         | 21.16  |\n| IPC MEXICO | 56193          | -2.08         | 8.63   |\n| MERVAL     | 1055381        | 13.52         | 393.64 |\n| BRAZIL-B   | 10.67          | 0.25          | -2.22  |\n| MEXICO     | 9.15           | 0.08          | -0.34  |\n\n<br>\n\n### Asia :<br><br>\n\n### India\n\nThe Indian rupee faced depreciation, surpassing the 83.25 mark on Friday, driven by a surge in global oil prices stemming from reduced output in Libya and disruptions in Red Sea tanker routes. The resultant increase in India's costs for importing crucial energy commodities intensified selling pressure on the rupee. In response, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has consistently intervened in foreign exchange markets to curb further losses, maintaining a delicate balance between a weakening yet stable rupee.<br>\n\nThe BSE Sensex concluded the week at 72,026, marking a 0.3% weekly decline. This dip was predominantly driven by the underperformance of heavyweight IT stocks, influenced by a less optimistic earnings outlook and diminished expectations of prompt rate cuts by the Fed, as revealed in the FOMC minutes release. The market's response to these factors contributed to the slight downturn in the overall Sensex performance for the week.\n\n<br>\n\n| Markets | Friday's Close | Week's Change | YTD   |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|\n| USD/INR | 83.10          | -0.10         | 1.01  |\n| SENSEX  | 72026          | -0.30         | 20.24 |\n\n<br>\n\n### EU :<br><br>\n\n### Russia\n\nRussian ruble weakened to around 91 per USD in January, primarily influenced by diminished liquidity during the holiday season and also the onging war expenditures which could impact the coutry's budget deficit negatively. \n\nThe ruble-based MOEX Russia index was little changed at 3136 on Friday. On the corporate front, the leaders of growth were Aeroflot (3.5%), VTB (3.2%), TMK (2.1%) and Severstal (1.2%). On the other hand, Sovcomflot (-3.3%), Seligdar (-1.6%), and M.Video (-1.6%) declined.\n\n### Turkey\n\nTurkish lira extended its decline, reaching a new record low of 29.8 per USD. Investor concerns heightened with a 49% hike in the minimum wage, raising fears of increased inflation, especially given the persistently high annual inflation rate of 64.8%. The Turkish government's announcement of a substantial minimum wage increase for 2024 aims to bolster support for the ruling party ahead of local elections in March. The Borsa Istanbul 100 index remained around the 7,500 level, and investors exercised caution, particularly with the upcoming municipal elections in late March, which could introduce uncertainties affecting investment decisions. This cautious approach might persist until after the election, impacting investor confidence and influencing market dynamics.\n\n<br>\n\n| Markets  | Friday's Close | Weekly Change | YTD   |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|\n| USD/RUB  | 90.92          | 1.88          | 25.42 |\n| USD/TRY  | 29.82          | 1.18          | 59.04 |\n| MOEX     | 3136           | 1.20          | 45.45 |\n| BIST 100 | 7629           | 2.12          | 42.81 |\n| TURKEY-B | 25.47          | 1.78          | 16.98 |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :\n\n| Markets | Friday's Close | Weely Change | YTD    |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:------------:|:------:|\n| USD/CHF | 0.85           | 0.96         | -8.38  |\n| USD/KRW | 90.92          | 1.88         | 25.42  |\n| USD/NGN | 913            | 3.63         | 103.09 |\n| USD/ZAR | 18.69          | 2.22         | 9.05   |\n| TAIEX   | 17519          | 2.30         | 21.89  |\n| NSE     | 79665          | 6.54         | 55.53  |\n\n---\n","tags":["Weekly Recap","Regional Markets"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Markets Recap - Global Markets Experience Decline","url":"/2024/01/06/macro_jan06/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **This week witnessed a global downturn in both stock and bond markets.

Beyond the tragic human toll, which saw the death toll surpassing 90 and hundreds still unaccounted for, there were significant economic repercussions. The earthquake inflicted major damage to infrastructure, particularly in areas housing semiconductor-related factories, posing a threat to manufacturing and supply chains. The damage may also influence the Bank of Japan's potential exit from the negative interest rate policy.<br>\n\n**Persistent concerns about the economy continued to weigh on the stock market.** The Shanghai Composite Index fell by 1.54%, while the blue-chip CSI 300 lost 2.97%. Economic indicators, including the PMI and declining housing prices, signal that the real estate sector remains a drag on the economy. In the bond market, China's 10-year government bond yield dropped to 2.54%, its lowest level since April 2020.

Despite weaker fundamentals compared to the previous week, the foreign exchange market operates in a relative context. This strength propelled the US dollar, sending other currencies into declining territory. Notably, the yen experienced a sharp drop, plummeting to the low 145 range against the U.S. dollar, down from approximately 141 at the end of the preceding week.<br>\n\n**Gold price slips.** The strength of the US dollar had a ripple effect on other asset classes. Gold prices slipped as the dollar strengthened, showcasing the inverse relationship between the two.<br>\n\n**Cryptocurrency prices experienced either small declines or remained flat.** A notable factor contributing to the market's stability was the rumored rejection of ETFs on June 3.

Stanley and Joel Lehman. This book challenges the conventional wisdom that setting specific goals is the key to achieving success. It introduces us to the concept of 'novelty search,' which essentially suggests that innovation and greatness might just stem from an unstructured exploration of our passions, rather than from chasing pre-set objectives. **<u>It's like what we often say: Keep your passion alive and live your life without limits.</u>**\n\n<br>\n\n## Content\n\n<br>\n\nThis book starts by contrasting goal-oriented thinking with a more open-ended, passion-driven exploration. The initial chapters bring in various examples to illustrate how a non-objective-driven approach could be more effective, particularly in complex\nand unpredictable scenarios. By Chapter 4, the book posits that having very specific goals might actually limit our potential and cause us to miss out on unforeseen opportunities. This is because overly complex and unprecedented goals are hard to measure, akin to predicting a path in a Markov chain - you can't know the past routes, but you understand that certain prerequisites need to exist for the desired outcome. Essentially, only those who are well-prepared and knowledgeable can seize these opportunities when they arise.\n\n<br>\n\nIn the subsequent chapters, the authors liken this process to being a treasure hunter, constantly reveling in the discovery of new things. Life is full of ups and downs, and people often wish for a restart, to see things from a different perspective. Imagine if life was a game where you could restart infinitely – the fastest path might seem appealing, but it would also strip away the element of surprise and discovery. The book's later chapters showcase real-world case studies where a novelty search approach led to significant breakthroughs across various fields. \n\n<br>\n\n**<u>The real message: Work hard, work smart, and with a bit of luck, you might meet serendipity.</u>**\n\n<br>\n\n## Analysis and Critique\n\n<br>\n\nTo be honest, I'm not entirely on board with the authors' emphasis on the dichotomy between aimlessness and goal-setting. **<u>While I don't advocate for a completely aimless approach, I do believe in setting broader, less specific long-term goals.</u>** For instance, the authors often mention that greatness is 'accidental.' In my view, the goals and methods we set are bound by our present understanding, rooted in past experiences. However, as we progress and evolve, our approaches may change, leading to outcomes that are different – and sometimes 'accidental' – compared to our original intentions. This suggests that we should aim for broad goals, remaining flexible in our journey.\n\n<br>\n\nAnother example they use interpretation of natural evolution. While the authors see diversity as a way to avoid competition which he called “none goal for survival “, I believe it's more about the broader goal of survival and reproduction. If we were to 'restart' life on Earth, humans might look completely different – like creatures from 'Avatar' or another alien species – as long as we're suited to survive. Under this broad goal, species evolve and diversify. So, there's always a goal, albeit not a highly specific one. Maybe It's about pursuing happiness or value, but exploring and discovering like treasure hunters on a path towards the best possible outcomes.\n\n<br><u>**In summary, I want to apply the concept of 'golden mean'  for this book, I recommedate this book for a balance between short-term practical objectives and long-term, vague ambitions. It's about holding onto your long-term goals while being open to abandoning unsuitable new ventures. The journey might be confusing or surprising at times, but that's the essence of life.** </u>\n\n<br>\n\n<u>**May you a journey filled with wonderful discoveries!** </u>\n\n---\n\n### \n","tags":["BookReview"],"categories":["Beyond"]},{"title":"Booklist for Jan","url":"/2024/01/01/booklist_jan/","content":"\n# Top Picks\n\n\n\n\n\n# Reade's choice\n\n- 《  Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned 》by Kenneth O.

Copper prices dipped slightly in the US, impacted by a stronger dollar and cooling labor market, while in China, supply disruptions were offset by year-end inventory releases. Aluminum found support in the EU and US from potential Fed interest rate cuts, indicated by lower economic indicators. Zinc and nickel, however, faced contrasting fortunes.** \n\n- **Zinc prices were subdued due to seasonal slowdowns and were further dampened by deliveries to LME warehouses. Nickel contended with the dual challenges of geopolitical tensions in the Red Sea and an increased supply, leading to a cautious short-term outlook. Overall, the base metal market was characterized by cautious trading and region-specific responses to global economic and geopolitical developments.** \n\n<br>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n### Copper :\n\n### <br><br>\n\n**In the last week of December, copper prices faced a slight decline in the US due to a rebound in the dollar index and cooling labor market, while in China, disruptions in supply were offset by year-end inventory clearances, but weakened demand and a lower PMI kept the market under pressure.** \n\n**European and US Markets :** \n\n<br>\n\nThe week began quietly with the London Metal Exchange (LME) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) closed for the Christmas holiday on Monday. The absence of significant overseas news during the holiday season put the markets in a wait-and-see mode initially.\n\n<br>\n\nPost-holiday, market sentiment was buoyed by expectations that the United States might start reducing interest rates soon. This anticipation led to a dip in the U.S. dollar index, generally a bullish signal for copper prices. However, the week also brought some concerns. The U.S. reported 218,000 initial jobless claims for the week ending December 23, higher than the forecasted 210,000. This indicates a cooling labor market, which, while potentially pointing to future interest rate cuts, did not immediately bolster copper prices.\n\n<br>\n\nMid-week, the U.S. dollar index rebounded due to investors closing their currency positions towards year-end, which applied downward pressure on copper prices. The week concluded with a modest 0.39% decline in CME's March 2024 copper futures. \n\n<br>\n\n**China's Market Dynamics :**\n\n<br>\n\nIn China, supply-side dynamics were affected by shipping schedule disruptions in certain regions, leading to anticipated delays in imported copper arrivals. This could mean a reduced supply of imported copper in the latter half of the week. Despite this, domestic sellers, aiming to clear year-end inventories, released substantial copper quantities into the market, balancing the supply equation.\n\n<br>\n\nOn the demand side, however, the pressure remained downwards. The final week of the year typically sees muted activity as companies engage in year-end settlements and only purchase as needed. This weak consumption trend was reflected in Shanghai copper's performance, which dropped in a lackluster market.\n\n<br>\n\nThe overall supply of copper remained stable, but high copper prices and significant discounts did not sufficiently stimulate downstream purchasing. The domestic Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for December stood at 49.0%, a 0.4 percentage point decrease from November, signaling a dip in manufacturing prosperity. This, coupled with the expected continued weak consumption, is likely to keep copper prices under pressure. \n\n<br><br>\n\n### Aluminum :\n\n**EU and US Markets :**\n\n<br>\n\nIn the United States, the core PCE price index's annual rate for November came in below expectations, indicating a more significant cooling in inflation than anticipated. This data, coupled with the downward revision of the actual GDP for the third quarter and consumption figures falling short of expectations, has bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve might consider interest rate cuts. This potential policy shift has provided support to aluminum prices, as lower interest rates can boost economic activity and demand for commodities like aluminum.<br>\n\n**China Market :**\n\n<br>\n\nDespite ongoing weak demand, the traditional off-season in China is impacting the aluminum market. Companies are focusing on cash flow towards the year's end, leading to reduced interest in restocking. It is expected that the reduction in aluminum ingot social inventory will decelerate, but overall inventory levels are likely to remain low. On the domestic macroeconomic front, the situation appears positive. Major state-owned banks have reduced deposit interest rates, which can stimulate economic activity.\n\n<br>\n\nFrom the supply side, low stocks and raw material support are expected to keep aluminum prices firm in the short term. Especially,aluminum can be more sensitive to energy costs and electricity prices, compared to copper, more sensitive to the overall economic health.  Additionally, recent complications in the Red Sea impacting transportation costs, and power load management in Qinghai Province due to earthquake relief efforts, might affect aluminum supply, further supporting prices.\n\n<br>\n\nThe Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) market was closed during the last Friday night session. On the London Metal Exchange (LME), aluminum opened at 2,368/mt last Friday, reaching highs and lows of 2,394.5/mt and 2,363/mt, respectively, before closing at 2,387.5/mt. This closing figure represents an increase of$20.5/mt or 0.87%. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) aluminum saw a notable gain of 2.83% over the week.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n### Zinc :\n\n**The performance of zinc last week closely mirrored that of copper.** The week saw interruptions in trading due to holidays, with the LME closed on Monday for Christmas and the SHFE zinc market shut on Friday for New Year's Day, including a suspension of night trading.\n\n<br>\n\nIn this context, SHFE zinc struggled to gain upward momentum, reflecting the impact of the off-season. The prices frequently retraced, aligning with the average levels of the preceding workdays. However, growing market optimism about a potential U.S. interest rate cut as early as March fueled bullish sentiments. This was further amplified by the declining U.S. dollar index, which generally bolsters commodity prices.\n\n<br>\n\nDespite this optimism, zinc prices on the LME were restrained. Deliveries to LME warehouses tempered the market's enthusiasm, resulting in a lack of significant upward movement for LME zinc. On the last trading day of the week, LME zinc opened at 2,634/ton, dipping to a low of 2,629/ton. However, during the night trading session, it reached a peak of US$2,675/ton before closing at 2,662/ton, up by 35/ton or 1.33%. Trading volume slightly decreased by 8 lots to 6,880 lots, while open interest saw a notable increase of 3,969 lots to 201,000 lots. Notably, LME zinc inventories rose by 2,700 tons to 224,825 tons, marking an increase of 1.22%.\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Nickel :\n\n**The increased supply, combined with geopolitical uncertainties and fluctuating raw material prices, points towards a potentially volatile market environment.**\n\n<br>\n\nIn the current macroeconomic landscape, geopolitical tensions are significantly influencing the nickel market. The recent escalation of the Red Sea crisis, stemming from the conflict between US military forces and Houthi armed forces on December 31, 2023, has heightened concerns over transportation disruptions in the Red Sea and Eurasian regions. This situation has the potential to increase market risk aversion, as the uncertainty around supply routes intensifies.\n\n<br>\n\nDespite these geopolitical challenges, the dynamics within the nickel market itself reveal a complex picture. The London Metal Exchange (LME) has reported a continuous accumulation of nickel inventory, particularly in Asian warehouses. This suggests a somewhat buffered supply, even in the face of potential transportation challenges.\n\n<br>\n\nFurthermore, the downward pricing trend in nickel sulphate and other raw materials, along with the recent lateral movement in SHFE (Shanghai Futures Exchange) nickel prices, has brought a notable shift. Refined nickel producers, who had previously been operating at a loss, are now seeing a return to profitability. Concurrently, some smelters have resumed normal production levels, indicating an anticipated increase in supply. Given these factors, the short-term outlook for nickel suggests a potential for downside pressure. \n\n<br><br>\n\n---\n\n| Future   | Friday's Close | Week's Change | YTD   |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|\n| Copper   | 3.88           | -0.39         | 1.97  |\n| Aluminum | 2,332.25       | 2.83          | -3.24 |\n| Zinc LME | 2,662          | -             | -     |\n| Nickel   |                |               |       |\n","tags":["Weekly Recap","Metals"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"A Playlist for Imagine Dragons","url":"/2023/12/31/playlist_dec31/","content":"\n# \n\n# \"Music has the power to move the soul\n\n# Imagine Dragons' anthems ignite the fire within.\"\n\n<br>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n### <br><br>\n\n## Playlist\n\n\"Symphony\"\n\n\"Natural\"\n\n\"Bones\"  \n\n\"Believer\" \n\n\"Thunder\" \n\n\"On Top of the World\" \n\n\"Enemy\" \n\n\"Sharks\" \n\n\"Higher Ground\" \n\n\"Only\" \n\n\"Love\" \n\n---\n\n### \n","tags":["Playlist"],"categories":["Beyond"]},{"title":"Markets Recap - Diverse Trends Define Year-End Landscape","url":"/2023/12/30/macro_dec30/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **Global markets present a mixed picture.

Meanwhile, the UK's FTSE 100 saw a notable rise of 0.6%.<br>\n\n**Quiet Bond Markets Anticipate ECB's Caution** In the bond markets, the week unfolded with a tranquil ambiance. The European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to refrain from raising interest rates, driven by concerns over cooling inflation and the looming possibility of a recession.

PMI data showed a mild expansion in Japan's private sector business activity, but a political scandal involving the ruling party impacted its popularity.<br>\n\nThe Chinese stock market experienced a decline due to deflationary pressures, with CPI continuing to decline by 0.5% compared to the previous year. Concerns about deflation triggering an economic downturn led to market worries. Other economic indicators presented mixed results, with industrial output growing, retail sales surging by 10%, and fixed asset investment rising, though it missed expectations.
